          "text": "Jewish name Isak Hauser – Eric Hauser – Yitzhak born in Gródek – very old town – grandfather president of Jewish community – old Jewish population and cemetery too.  Went to Catholic high school due to influence of grandfather – valedictorian.  Decided to study engineering.  Polish polytechnic school didn’t accept Jewish students – had to go to Czechoslovakia – engineering – masters in electricity and mechanical engineering.  Not accepted in Poland.  Had to undergo exam in Poland – didn’t get work near Lwów where Parents where.  Father building contractor – built small houses – approximately three hundred.  He had to give mortgages – well to do.  I couldn’t get job. Got job in West Galacia in Jewish firm.  I became assistant manager of oil fields.  Built a house there.  Forty to sixty oil fields.  I made a few inventions. I have patents (all obsolete now) war started in 1939.\nFather built houses – sister studied to be attorney – brother accountant – sister owned big house in Lemberg.  We all worked very hard.  Though well –to-do, life not easy.  Countless pressure from Poles – resented Jews were wealthy and always trying to ruin father’s business.  Built church three miles from our building establishment and then said offensive to have business so close – fought with bribes.  I wanted to work as engineer.  Father wanted me in his field.  I was left wing and socialist - most Jewish youth were.  No hope in present Polish government and way treated us.  Arthur Kissler saying – “Red hot sun from the east will melt down the injustices from the west.” – believed in it.  Father disagreed so I had to leave it and find work.  Sister married an attorney and later emigrated to Russia – promptly shot by Stalin as Polish spy.  She bought movie house – father building huge house in Lwów – finished as first bombs fell in 1939.  Father always paid his debts – thought his work as “good as gold.” (crying). While the bombs were falling, he paid his debts. "

I was left with 220 hungry workers and no payroll.  A little money in bank – 250 zlotys and gave everyone ten zlotys.  Negligible money but showed good will – they didn’t tear me apart.  Workers mostly Poles – saved one man’s life – Ukrainian mechanic – Poles believed all Ukrainians were spies.  (Ukrainians sided with Germans and fought against Poland in 1918)\nUkrainian nice fellow – not a spy – war started and Polish army came and asked for Ukrainian.  Stood him against a wall – his wife came to me and I ran to sergeant and said vouch with my life for this man – said he was not political but a mechanic.  They let him go.  Later on he helped me during German time war lasted four days.  Polish army crumbled and moved east.  Our order to dismantle oil well and make them dysfunctional.  We did – we threw things into well and took apart machines – we ran away.  My name broadcast over radio by Germans to come back.  They wanted me to help put together wells again.  I knew once I showed up they would kill me so ignored.  Running all night because during day were everywhere.  I had an old car I had practically built myself.  Four others with me and drove by night on country roads.  Roads made of white stone and could be seen by moonlight.  Didn’t see wall and drove at full speed into river – broke steering wheel of my car.  Probably broke a few ribs – no time to even find car – impact threw me to other side of road – people in back seat flying over my head.  \n\tLeft car on road and by foot went to next railroad station – last Polish train leaving station.  Was splattered with blood because had been straffed by German plane.  At last a train – went to Lemberg – on Russian side.  "

Russians in – father was “owner” – employed three to ten  people – father wealthy.\nCrime according to Russians – crime for children of owner too – tainted for life.  I was known – Lemberg so had to leave.  Went to Boryslaw – uncles and aunts there – 1939 – got job – had diploma as EE – got job in power plant – beautiful plant.  I was head of mechanic and electric department.  Peculiar experience to work for Russians.  Reason I do this interview is to show Russians broke our spirit.  Germans killed us physically, Russians killed us mentally.  Converted us from normal human beings with hope and ambitions, to ants scurrying and for food everyday.  Have special method – made us like Pavlovian dogs – stores operating only during working hours.  Wife and I both worked so couldn’t go to stores – had to continuously break the law – smuggled selves out, smuggled food – cut in lines, etc – like living in a prison.  American prisoner compared to this a holiday work all day and fight for food – great invention of Stalin.  Work most important though.  Food and other needs your problem.  Israelis went into desert with Moses and rebelled against him because remembered food in Egypt – found out do not have to feed slaves.  Just make the work and they’ll muddle through no time to think – always busy trying to get by.  Russian law permits six square miles per person.  Threw us out of our apartment – didn’t let us take furniture – just few eating utensils.  Russian police like apartment so you lose it.  Could struggle – broke us deeply and completely – made it easy for Hitler.  \nBoryslaw oil mining town – Klondike life – miners with arms – rough life.  Fighting all the time – not afraid – but after “Russian cure” “they were all like lambs.” "

Germans attacked in June 1941 – Russian army ran and left all heavy equipment – six to eight hours with no Russians or Germans.  Parents of children went to prison to get children – found shallow grave in prison yard with all children – shot in head – some hands tied with barbed wire.  Execution in Russia – tiny cell with door and opening at height of head – prisoners tied to door and shot through opening - executioner cannot be seen.  Parents remembered remark of Jew and rumor started Jews have killed our children.  Ukrainians hated Jews to begin with.  United with Polish parents and rounded up families of truck drivers and all Jews they knew and brutally killed them.  Forced to crawl – kiss dead bodies and beg forgiveness.  Beaten o death with lead and iron pipes.  Few survived because decent Ukrainians pulled out their own friends – one pulled out – the Rabbi.  One pulled out one of my friends named Bauer.  I lost thirty people of close family.  I escaped – I went to family and told them to disperse.  They refused because felt safer together – all died together.  I ran away and hid out – German occupied – as soon as Germans in, Jews had to register – I registered as engineering and technician man – gave Ausweis – (shows it) – later on all kinds of classification to decrease Jewish population – 16-18,000 Jews in Boryslaw – even had Jewish mayor at sometime.  Brought in Jews from small surrounding communities – estimated 20,000-25,000 – passed through ghetto of Boryslaw.  Drohohych next – sister town – ghetto estimated one week after Germans came in.  "
