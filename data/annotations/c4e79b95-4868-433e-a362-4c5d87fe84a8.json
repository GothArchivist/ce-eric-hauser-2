              "text": "1. Sidney had married Shirley Levine (1917-1990) and they had a daughter, Phyllis, in 1943. U.S. draft policies in World War II were such that, with a wife and child, Sidney was not immediately drafted. The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, also known as the Burke–Wadsworth Act, enacted September 16, 1940, “was the first peacetime conscription in United States history. This Selective Service Act required that men who had reached their 21st birthday but had not yet reached their 36th birthday register with local draft boards. Later, when the U.S. entered World War II, all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 45th birthday were made subject to military service, and all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 65th birthday were required to register.… By the early summer of 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked the U.S. Congress to extend the term of duty for the draftees beyond twelve months to a total of thirty months, plus any additional time that he could deem necessary for national security…. After the United States entered World War II, amendments to the Selective Training and Service Act on December 20, 1941, made all men between the ages of 20 and 44 liable for military service, and required all men between the ages of 18 and 64 to register.… From October 1940 until March 1947, when the wartime Selective Training and Service Act expired after extensions by Congress, over 10,000,000 men were inducted.” More broadly, the U.S. federal government has turned to the draft six times in history (American Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts). Conscription came to an end only in 1973 when the United States Armed Forces became all-voluntary. See “Selective Training and the Selective Service Act of 1940, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Training_and_Service_Act_of_1940 (accessed 21 March 2022). From October 1940 until March 1947“49 million men had been registered, 36 million classified, and 10 million inducted.” See “Conscription in the United States” at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States (accessed 21 March 2022)."

              "text": "2. A brief word on the facilities mentioned by Bruskin: “Armory Court,” one observer noted, “is a building of power. Located at the north end of Orange Street, right before East Rock Park, this ‘medieval castle’ stands out imposingly from the residential surroundings. Its hexagonal towers and battlements have an instantly recognizable silhouette, an homage to Romanesque architecture that creates a sense of security for the condominium complex that lies behind the large iron gate. While the owners of Armory Court have changed through the last century, the building has retained its present form for more than a hundred years. Built in 1906, it was used as a barracks and stable for the Troop A Cavalry, a part of the Connecticut National Guard. It remained in use by the military until 1970, when it was acquired by the former South Central Community College, which used the building’s powerful image to house their administration office building. After renovations in 1987, Armory Court assumed its present function - a condominium complex divided into small, single-family rowhouse apartments.” See (https://nhba.yale.edu/building?id=5e596a2ab5abb055a040dfc0 (accessed 21 March 2022) more detailed account of the Armory, with its rich material history, adds: “When the armory closed around 2009, and the City of New Haven gained possession, veterans from the 102nd Regiment removed a portrait of Sargent Stubby, the 102nd regiment’s famous war dog, as well as the furnishings and restaged the room for exhibit in the West Haven Veteran’s Museum and Learning Center circa 2010. 7 WPA murals feature the Foot Guards’ most famous lore: Benedict Arnold’s famous march to the New Haven Green to demand the keys to the powder house on the eve of the Revolution. Around 2010, original light fixtures and wood paneling were removed to Yale University, the West Haven Veterans Museum, and the new Foot Guard headquarters at the armory in Branford, Connecticut…. From the end of its construction in 1930 through 2009, the armory has served as a center for military preparations and disaster relief, and as a clubhouse for those serving. The building is also significant at the state level in the category of Social History as a host for large community, state, and regional celebrations and events over several decades. This includes New Haven’s African American activist community, who in the 1970s, continued to work for social and economic justice in the later years of the Civil Rights Movement.” See https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DECD/Historic-Preservation/06_About_SHPO/State-Review-Board/Dec-4-2020/New-Haven-Armory-NR.pdf"

This sometimes resulted in friction, with the phrase ‘over-paid, over-sexed, and over-here’ becoming commonplace. In Bruskin’s case, the new father evidently was not interested in British women, but in making some money. His account relates how he sought to transact business, indeed, to ply his trade, while stationed abroad. While Bruskin’s wife had taken over his bike business back in New Haven, he still hoped to contribute to the family income while in the service. That he found time to entertain purchases indicates the relatively relaxed atmosphere prior to D-Day and the actual fighting against the Germans. See Juliet Gardiner, "

The beach is about six miles wide and as the Allies landed some 34,000 troops that day (most delivered away from the planned locations), they came under heavy fire from the Germans and their allies. They eventually prevailed in the days that followed. The Allies removed the obstacles to amphibious landings, including taking out 250 massive steel “Belgian Gate” barricades and 11,000 beams used as anti-tank and anti-landing craft defenses. By the time Bruskin arrived at D-plus-30, Omaha Beach had become a transit center that facilitated the liberation of Normandy and then all of France.

On 5 August 1944, the 80th Infantry landed at Utah Beach and then fought its way across France until they ran out of gas at the river Seille. They later fought at the Battle of the Bulge, where they helped rescue the 101 st Airborne Division under siege in Bastogne. The 80 th Division crossed the Rhine on 27–28 March, near Mainz and subsequently fought in Kassel, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Nuremberg, among other locations. The U.S. Army’s 80th infantry division had a storied history during WWII as part of General George Patton’s Third Army and the division featured a notable branch of the Counterintelligence Corps, or CIC.

Journalist Guy Walters notes of the CIC, “Originally established in August 1917 as the Corps of Intelligence Police, the fifty-strong unit ran counter-espionage operations in northern France toward the end of the First World War. Between the wars it underwent various mutations, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor it was renamed the CIC and authorized to recruit 1,026 non-commissioned officers. This was rapidly swelled to 4,431, with a provision for 543 officers. The men selected for the CIC were often expected to have some form of legal experience, although as the war went on this requirement was waived, and recruits were merely expected to have an adequate education, be of ‘good character,’ and loyal to the flag…. The CIC was not a haven for shirkers, however. Six of its units came ashore in Normandy on D-Day and counter-espionage work is not without its dangers.” Guy Walters, "

By the time the Allies had entered Germany, the CIC’s role was to arrest Nazis and other Germans who represented a threat to the Allied forces. In addition to ‘normal’ counter-espionage work, the CIC had to secure Nazi party buildings in order to safeguard the documents they contained…. The British may have been envious of the resources the American Nazi-hunting units had at their disposal, but they were a little sniffy about their methods. ‘They were very gung-ho,’ recalled John Hodge, a captain in the British War Crimes Team; ‘they all had pistols and went ‘come on, let’s go get him!’” Walters, "

In 1933, there were about 35,000 mixed marriages in Germany and by 1939 there were about 20,000 (with the number dropping to 12,000 by the end of 1944). The decline was partly due to demographics, partly to Nazi authorities putting pressure on Christians to divorce Jewish spouses, and partly due to the genocide that occurred later in the war. For most of the Third Reich, the Jewish partners in a mixed marriage were considered ‘privileged,’ and, as journalist Yoav Sapir noted, “For the Jewish partner, being privileged meant a lot. Unlike other Jews, the privileged ones were not forced to wear the Jewish star as of 1941. And they were not included in the deportations until the end of the war.” See Yoav Sapir, ‘Mixed Marriages in Nazi Germany,’ The New York Jewish Week (23 February 2017), https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/mixed-marriages-in-nazi-germany/ (accessed 17 June 2021). About 10,000 Jews in mixed marriages survived the war. Bruskin also relates the woman’s efforts to sustain her identity with the clandestine prayer book and the Jewish cuisine. Note also the precarious nature of the timing of this “incident”: the war was not yet over and the woman continued to fear the German authorities. For more on these issues, see Marion Kaplan, "

With regard to his knowledge of concentration camps, Bruskin’s testimony contains certain inconsistencies: he first says he knew nothing about them, but then acknowledges that he had heard the inmates were not treated well. He seems to suggest that one didn’t “know” about a concentration camp unless one grasped the tremendous suffering there. He comments that his colleagues with G-2 (intelligence) training had a better understanding of the camps, although he implies that one cannot really comprehend them unless one was physically there. The smells and the physical condition of the inmates, for example, defy easy description. Prior to the liberation of Ebensee in early May, other camps had been liberated by the Allies, including Buchenwald on 11 April (by the Americans) and Bergen-Belsen on 15 April (by the British). Information regarding these camps was beginning to spread by the time Bruskin arrived at Ebensee."

There were frequent airplane crashes (that took the lives of figures like Fritz Todt, Wladyslaw Sikorski, and the musician Glenn Miller). Motor vehicle accidents also took the lives of many combatants, including General George Patton. Note Bruskin’s comments about being shelled applied to his experiences in France (a dangerous phase of the war for him), but he was later also under fire in Germany. Bruskin was quite nonchalant about the shelling. It is striking that he felt more endangered in France than later in Germany. This may have had something to do with his lack of experience—he became accustomed to artillery over time—but clearly the fighting in the Normandy region in the summer of 1944 was still intense."

He was the highest-ranking member of the SS to be tried at the International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg. The best study on him remains Peter Black's biography from 1984, which portrays Kaltenbrunner as a radical Nazi and chronicles the Austrian's rise to the top of the SS security apparatus. Black discusses Kaltenbrunner’s last days, after he left his political headquarters in Salzburg to head to Altaussee, which attracted many high-ranking Nazis at the war's end (see below), including Kaltenbrunner's childhood friend, Adolf Eichmann, who also took refuge in the mountains surrounding the town. On Kaltenbrunner’s trial before the IMT, Black notes: \"Most remarkable in Kaltenbrunner’s prison writings is the absence of any guilt, remorse, or even reflection on the millions of innocent people who had been murdered by the regime that he served or who had died as a result of its policies. On the contrary, he appears to have been convinced that he had always done right, that his actions had been necessary, and 'history' would someday prove this.\" Peter Black, "

Located at the end of a long road heading deep into the Salzkammergut, Altaussee was a good location to stash art and for Nazis to hide out. The town was part of the Ausseerland region, which Hitler and his associates envisioned as part of the so-called Alpine Fortress. The town attracted an array of leading Nazis, including Kaltenbrunner, Adolf Eichmann, SS commando Otto Skorzeny, Viennese Gauleiter Hugo Jury, Franz Stangl (commandant of Sobibor and Treblinka) and Anton Burger (Commandant of the Theresienstadt concentration camp). Walters offered an extension of this list: “In Altaussee… among those arrested were General Erich Alt of the Luftwaffe, Walter Riedel, the construction chief of the V-2 rocket program at Peenemünde; Günther Altenburg, the German Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece; William Knothe, General Counsel of the Foreign Office; and Dr. Bailent Homan, a minister in the Hungarian puppet government installed by the Nazis.” In other words, Altaussee was an extraordinarily rich target area for Matteson, Bruskin, and their team.

From here, with the help of an RSHA staffer named Wilhelm Höttl, he became embroiled in Operation Sunrise: an effort to conclude a negotiated peace for Italy and western Austria with the Western Allies. While those negotiations bore fruit (a separate peace was concluded on 29 April), troops from the U.S. Seventh Army arrived on 8 May (the day the Soviets concluded their treaty of surrender with the German government), and Kaltenbrunner again took flight. He headed to the hills near Wildensee, just outside Altaussee, where he hid out until 12 May 1945. At the end of the war a box of 50-60 kilograms of gold and other valuables was found near the house in which Kaltenbrunner had lived. Walters adds: “Kaltenbrunner’s house in Altaussee was the Villa Kerry, which was situated on the outskirts of town and looked over the lake. Before he fled, like some villain in a potboiler, Kaltenbrunner buried his treasure in his garden. According to one estimate, he had shipped to Altaussee 50 kilograms of gold bars, fifty cases containing gold articles, two million US dollars, the same number of Swiss francs, five cases of jewels, and a stamp collection worth five million gold marks.” Walters, "

Reinhard Heydrich (1904-4 June1942), number two in the SS, the preceding chief of the RSHA (which included the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD), the man who chaired the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, and the Acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, was assassinated by Czech partisans. Heydrich died from an infection (sepsis) caused by the horsehair fibers in the seat of his car, which entered his wounds after a kind of hand-grenade exploded near him. Hitler ordered a reprisal—the execution of 10,000 randomly chosen Czechs—but subordinates counseled that this measure could hurt the productivity of the important industrial region. The Germans instead decided to enact revenge in the towns of Lidice and Lezaky: on 10 June 1942, males over the age of 16 in both towns were murdered; and all the women in Lezaky were killed. Both towns were burned to the ground. Estimates are that some 1,300 Czechs were killed in reprisal for Heydrich’s death, including at least 200 women. Edouard Calic, "

Kaltenbrunner also maintained he was unaware of the Holocaust, and in a contradictor manner, stated that he had protested against the treatment of the Jews to Himmler and Hitler. He went so far as to claim that he deserved credit for bringing the Final Solution to an end. On 30 September 1946, the International Military Tribunal found Kaltenbrunner not guilty of crimes against peace, but guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity (counts three and four). On 1 October 1946, the IMT sentenced him to death by hanging. Kaltenbrunner was executed 16 October 1946, and his corpse, like those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann Göring (who had committed suicide the previous day), was cremated at the Eastern Cemetery in Munich and the ashes scattered in a tributary of the Isar River.

The treatment of liberated inmates was by no means uniform, with some experiencing discrimination, mistreatment, and terrible conditions. Earl Harrison, an American representative to the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees, commented at one point, “we appear to be treating the Jews as the Nazi treated them except that we do not exterminate them.” Jennifer Orth-Veillon noted, “…not all soldiers acted equally when confronted with that responsibility, and some further mistreated them, extending the trauma they had endured while imprisoned.” See Jennifer Orth-Veillon, “For Some Holocaust Survivors, Even Liberation Was Dehumanizing,” in "

The quality of the notes was very high and threatened the British economy, but the Germans never found a way to insert the notes into circulation: they had considered dropping them from planes, but did not pursue that option, and instead used the fake money to fund special operations. In early March 1945, the inmates in the counterfeiting unit were transferred to the concentration camp of Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria. Some of the Sachsenhausen prisoners ended up at Ebensee, which, as noted earlier, was also part of the Mauthausen-complex. The prisoners were ordered to destroy the evidence of the operation.

Upon his release in 1937, he moved to Austria and by 1940 had obtained German citizenship.

When Baillie-Stewart was arrested by Matteson and Bruskin at Altaussee in 1945 he was wearing Lederhosen and trying to blend in with the local population. Subsequently he was sent to Britain to be tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he became known as ‘the officer in the Tower’ (he was often confused with Lord Haw-Haw). Baillie-Stewart was subsequently charged with “committing an act likely to assist the enemy” and sentenced to five years in prison. He was fortunate: William Joyce, who had been captured in Flensburg on 28 May 1945, was treated more harshly: charged with high treason, found guilty, and executed in 1946.

She endured the initial German attack on Poland before being evacuated with other officials on 5 September. This entailed a harrowing twelve-day journey across Poland to Romania during which they experienced bombardment from German planes and machine-gun attacks. Prince Alexander reached Budapest and then reunited with his wife, before heading to New York, where they arrived on 4 November 1939. How Prince von Hohenlohe was arrested in Europe in 1945 by Robert Matteson is not clear."

              "text": "George (Gyorgi) Havas (1929-2012) was born in Mukacheve, Czechoslovakia (today Ukraine). He experienced the Hungarian take-over of his town in late-1938, after the Germans were given the Sudetenland and arranged the award of land to Hungary. Havas was transported to Auschwitz on 15 May 1944, and then on to Mauthausen and then to Ebensee, where he spent one year prior to liberation. His father was a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz who perished in the October 1944 uprising. George Havas worked in the notorious tunnels at Ebensee. He lost his brother and several friends in the Ebensee camp. Only 16 when he was liberated, Havas was featured in some of the photos of the camp taken when the Americans arrived. See, for example, image 76788, at the USHMM at https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa7325. He immigrated to the USA in 1947 and lived in Virginia prior to his death in 2012. See the oral history interview with George Havas at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, RG-50.030.0378, https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn504871 (accessed 26 August 2021). There is also an interview with Havas connected with the memorial at Ebensee: https://memorial-ebensee.at/website/index.php/de/geschichte/19-konzentrationslager/9-zeitzeugeninterview-havas (accessed 27 August 2021)."
