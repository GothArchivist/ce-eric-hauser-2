Sidney had married Shirley Levine (1917-1990) and they had a daughter, Phyllis, in 1943. U.S. draft policies in World War II were such that, with a wife and child, Sidney was not immediately drafted. The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, also known as the Burke–Wadsworth Act, enacted September 16, 1940, “was the first peacetime conscription in United States history. This Selective Service Act required that men who had reached their 21st birthday but had not yet reached their 36th birthday register with local draft boards. Later, when the U.S. entered World War II, all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 45th birthday were made subject to military service, and all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 65th birthday were required to register.… By the early summer of 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked the U.S. Congress to extend the term of duty for the draftees beyond twelve months to a total of thirty months, plus any additional time that he could deem necessary for national security…. After the United States entered World War II, amendments to the Selective Training and Service Act on December 20, 1941, made all men between the ages of 20 and 44 liable for military service, and required all men between the ages of 18 and 64 to register.… From October 1940 until March 1947, when the wartime Selective Training and Service Act expired after extensions by Congress, over 10,000,000 men were inducted.” More broadly, the U.S. federal government has turned to the draft six times in history (American Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts). Conscription came to an end only in 1973 when the United States Armed Forces became all-voluntary.

A brief word on the facilities mentioned by Bruskin: “Armory Court,” one observer noted, “is a building of power. Located at the north end of Orange Street, right before East Rock Park, this ‘medieval castle’ stands out imposingly from the residential surroundings. Its hexagonal towers and battlements have an instantly recognizable silhouette, an homage to Romanesque architecture that creates a sense of security for the condominium complex that lies behind the large iron gate. While the owners of Armory Court have changed through the last century, the building has retained its present form for more than a hundred years. Built in 1906, it was used as a barracks and stable for the Troop A Cavalry, a part of the Connecticut National Guard. It remained in use by the military until 1970, when it was acquired by the former South Central Community College, which used the building’s powerful image to house their administration office building. After renovations in 1987, Armory Court assumed its present function - a condominium complex divided into small, single-family rowhouse apartments.” See (https://nhba.yale.edu/building?id=5e596a2ab5abb055a040dfc0 (accessed 21 March 2022) more detailed account of the Armory, with its rich material history, adds: “When the armory closed around 2009, and the City of New Haven gained possession, veterans from the 102nd Regiment removed a portrait of Sargent Stubby, the 102nd regiment’s famous war dog, as well as the furnishings and restaged the room for exhibit in the West Haven Veteran’s Museum and Learning Center circa 2010. 7 WPA murals feature the Foot Guards’ most famous lore: Benedict Arnold’s famous march to the New Haven Green to demand the keys to the powder house on the eve of the Revolution. Around 2010, original light fixtures and wood paneling were removed to Yale University, the West Haven Veterans Museum, and the new Foot Guard headquarters at the armory in Branford, Connecticut…. From the end of its construction in 1930 through 2009, the armory has served as a center for military preparations and disaster relief, and as a clubhouse for those serving. The building is also significant at the state level in the category of Social History as a host for large community, state, and regional celebrations and events over several decades. This includes New Haven’s African American activist community, who in the 1970s, continued to work for social and economic justice in the later years of the Civil Rights Movement.” See https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DECD/Historic-Preservation/06_About_SHPO/State-Review-Board/Dec-4-2020/New-Haven-Armory-NR.pdf","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"}],"target":"https://GothArchivist.github.io/ce-eric-hauser-2/eric_hauser_part_1_of_2/canvas/1#t=156.808,189.19"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://GothArchivist.github.io/ce-eric-hauser-2/eric_hauser_part_1_of_2/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"3.

His account relates how he sought to transact business, indeed, to ply his trade, while stationed abroad. While Bruskin’s wife had taken over his bike business back in New Haven, he still hoped to contribute to the family income while in the service. That he found time to entertain purchases indicates the relatively relaxed atmosphere prior to D-Day and the actual fighting against the Germans.

For the history of the 80th Division, see the website regarding the 80 th Infantry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80th_Division_(United_States). On 5 August 1944, the 80th Infantry landed at Utah Beach and then fought its way across France until they ran out of gas at the river Seille. They later fought at the Battle of the Bulge, where they helped rescue the 101 st Airborne Division under siege in Bastogne. The 80 th Division crossed the Rhine on 27–28 March, near Mainz and subsequently fought in Kassel, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Nuremberg, among other locations. The U.S. Army’s 80th infantry division had a storied history during WWII as part of General George Patton’s Third Army and the division featured a notable branch of the Counterintelligence Corps, or CIC. The CIC had evolved from the Military Intelligence Service’s Counter Intelligence Branch. Utilizing information provided by the Office of Strategic Services, or OSS, which was another branch of the War Department and a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIC was tasked with “locating criminals, Nazi records, and looted property.” Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, Plunder and Restitution (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2000), SR-218. Journalist Guy Walters notes of the CIC, “Originally established in August 1917 as the Corps of Intelligence Police, the fifty-strong unit ran counter-espionage operations in northern France toward the end of the First World War. Between the wars it underwent various mutations, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor it was renamed the CIC and authorized to recruit 1,026 non-commissioned officers. This was rapidly swelled to 4,431, with a provision for 543 officers. The men selected for the CIC were often expected to have some form of legal experience, although as the war went on this requirement was waived, and recruits were merely expected to have an adequate education, be of ‘good character,’ and loyal to the flag…. The CIC was not a haven for shirkers, however. Six of its units came ashore in Normandy on D-Day and counter-espionage work is not without its dangers.” Guy Walters, Hunting Evil: The Nazi War Criminals Who Escaped and the Quest to Bring Them to Justice (New York: Broadway Books, 2009), 63. Walters adds, “After the invasion [of Normandy] the principal role of the CIC detachments was to screen displaced persons, and to determine whether they were enemy agents or war criminals masquerading as civilians. By the time the Allies had entered Germany, the CIC’s role was to arrest Nazis and other Germans who represented a threat to the Allied forces. In addition to ‘normal’ counter-espionage work, the CIC had to secure Nazi party buildings in order to safeguard the documents they contained…. The British may have been envious of the resources the American Nazi-hunting units had at their disposal, but they were a little sniffy about their methods. ‘They were very gung-ho,’ recalled John Hodge, a captain in the British War Crimes Team; ‘they all had pistols and went ‘come on, let’s go get him!’” Walters, Hunting Evil, 63. Despite the enthusiasm of CIC personnel, they suffered from a shortage of translators. As one history of the organization notes, “The greatest single CIC procurement problem during the war was the difficulty in obtaining linguists who were qualified for CIC duty... As reports poured in to the Office of the Chief from tactical units throughout the world, all stressed the need for agents who could conduct interrogations in the native languages of the countries in which they were serving.” George Chalou, Covert Warfare: The Counter Intelligence Corps in Action (New York: Garland, 1989), chapter 7 (no page numbers provided).

Bruskin here speaks to the survival of German Jews, either due to being in a ‘mixed-marriage’ or as ‘U-boats.’ Even though the Nazis had made such marriages illegal as part of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, the law did not annul existing marriages. In 1933, there were about 35,000 mixed marriages in Germany and by 1939 there were about 20,000 (with the number dropping to 12,000 by the end of 1944). The decline was partly due to demographics, partly to Nazi authorities putting pressure on Christians to divorce Jewish spouses, and partly due to the genocide that occurred later in the war. For most of the Third Reich, the Jewish partners in a mixed marriage were considered ‘privileged,’ and, as journalist Yoav Sapir noted, “For the Jewish partner, being privileged meant a lot. Unlike other Jews, the privileged ones were not forced to wear the Jewish star as of 1941. And they were not included in the deportations until the end of the war.” See Yoav Sapir, ‘Mixed Marriages in Nazi Germany,’ The New York Jewish Week (23 February 2017), https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/mixed-marriages-in-nazi-germany/ (accessed 17 June 2021). About 10,000 Jews in mixed marriages survived the war. Bruskin also relates the woman’s efforts to sustain her identity with the clandestine prayer book and the Jewish cuisine.

Bruskin developed a curious relationship with the two women: even the fact that Scheidler’s wife (Iris Scheidler) and Kaltenbrunner’s mistress were living in the same house raises questions. \n\n\nCountess Gisela von Westarp (1920-1983) had married Paul Wolf (1912-1943) in 1940, but he died in Tunis in 1943. Countess Westarp went on to have twins by Ernst Kaltenbrunner (a boy and a girl), who “had been delivered in a cowshed in the village [Altaussee] on March 12 [1945].” She and the children survived the war, initially living in a two-room flat in Munich, according to Der Spiegel magazine in 1947. Walters, Hunting Evil, 12-13. “Gräfin Gisela von Westarp,” in Der Spiegel 9 (28 February 1947). Kaltenbrunner had married Elisabeth Eder in 1934 and they had three children, who also survived the war.\n\n\nWalters says, “Scheidler’s wife was a vivacious and attractive thirty-three-year old brunette called Iris. A Viennese by birth, Iris had previously been married to a Dr. Rudolf Praxmarer, who was a friend of Kaltenbrunner when they had studies at the University of Graz. The couple separated amicably in July 1943, and Iris became frau Scheidler the following month…. She combined parenthood with working for the official Nazi photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, which gave her access to what passed for high society in Nazi Germany, including Eva Braun and Baldur von Schirach, the leader of the Hitler Youth. In short, the Scheidlers were a well-connected couple, and they were at the heart of the Kaltenbrunner clique in Altaussee.” Walters, Hunting Evil, 13.\n\n\nBoth sides used one another. The women sought information about their husband/boyfriend, as well as more lenient treatment. The Allies sought the location of the suspects and useful information.

He leaves out certain specifics, of course, such as that Adolf Eichmann was with Kaltenbrunner in the escape from Altaussee and before he separated from his group and hiked through the mountains heading north (he was captured later and then escaped again to South America). Bruskin also did not note that the assistant Burgermeister of Altaussee, Johann Brandauer, was the one to reveal the location of Kaltenbrunner’s hideout in the Todes Gebirg; Brandauer accompanied the detachment of ex-Wehrmacht soldiers and US troops. The mission entailed climbing over mountainous and glacial terrain for six hours in darkness before arriving at the cabin. See The Last Days of Ernst Kaltenbrunner, CIA–Kent School: Center for the Study of Intelligence (retrieved 14 July 2019). Walters tells a similar story, referring to Matteson as “a political–science teacher and a Harvard MA,” with “his interpreter Sydney Bruskin.” See Walters, Hunting Evil, 15. Regarding the capture that took place on 11/12 May 1945, Walters writes: “Matteson’s motley crew departed at midnight, their leader sporting a pair of Lederhosen, an Alpine jacket and hat, and spoked shoes. The plan was for an unarmed Matteson to pose as an innocent passerby…” See Walters, Hunting Evil, 16.  Matteson indeed approached the hut by himself, with his US GIs and four German guides remaining at a distance. Matteson knocked on the door, and one of Kaltenbrunner’s assitants answered it. Matteson asked to come in, but was refused. At that moment, Kaltenbrunner’s aide spotted Matteson’s support team and slammed the door. A standoff ensued, but Kaltenbrunner chose to avoid a fire-fight and surrendered. Matteson brought him back to Altaussee. See Walters, Hunting Evil, 15-18. So, Bruskin was there for Kaltenbrunner’s arrest. He assented to the decision to allow Kaltenbrunner to have a final meetingwith his mistress, Countess von Westarp. Bruskin and Matteson probably knew it would be difficult for her to see him after his arrest (unlike Kaltenbrunners wife, who had some rights). It is somewhat surprising that Sydney Bruskin and Robert Matteson didn’t recognize Kaltenbrunner, whose distinctive scars were famous.\n\n\nAt the International Tribunal at Nuremberg, Kaltenbrunner was charged with conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. He was acquitted of the first charge, but found guilty of the latter two. He had not been present at the beginning of the proceedings after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage, but when he returned, he protested his innocence, claiming that Himmler and Gestapo leader Heinrich Müller bore responsibility for the atrocities committed during his tenure as chief of the RSHA. Kaltenbrunner also maintained he was unaware of the Holocaust, and in a contradictor manner, stated that he had protested against the treatment of the Jews to Himmler and Hitler. He went so far as to claim that he deserved credit for bringing the Final Solution to an end. On 30 September 1946, the International Military Tribunal found Kaltenbrunner not guilty of crimes against peace, but guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity (counts three and four). On 1 October 1946, the IMT sentenced him to death by hanging. Kaltenbrunner was executed 16 October 1946, and his corpse, like those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann Göring (who had committed suicide the previous day), was cremated at the Eastern Cemetery in Munich and the ashes scattered in a tributary of the Isar River.

Wolff was subsequently treated very leniently by the Allies, and faced minimal justice only late in his life.

For top Austrian Nazis like Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Adolf Eichmann, and the others previously mentioned as present in Altaussee, among others, they hoped that their knowledge of this region of the Alps would enable them to escape from the enemy.

The Prince was a Polish national (with an American mother) and his wife was the stepdaughter of the U.S. ambassador to Poland, Antony Drexel Biddle, Jr. Prince von Hohenlohe and Peggy Schulze had married in October 1938 in Paris after a four-month courtship. At the start of September 1939, the Prince was mobilized with the Polish armed forces and Peggy stayed with her mother and stepfather. She endured the initial German attack on Poland before being evacuated with other officials on 5 September. This entailed a harrowing twelve-day journey across Poland to Romania during which they experienced bombardment from German planes and machine-gun attacks. Prince Alexander reached Budapest and then reunited with his wife, before heading to New York, where they arrived on 4 November 1939. How Prince von Hohenlohe was arrested in Europe in 1945 by Robert Matteson is not clear.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"}],"target":"https://GothArchivist.github.io/ce-eric-hauser-2/eric_hauser_part_1_of_2/canvas/1#t=3068.318,3109.7"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://GothArchivist.github.io/ce-eric-hauser-2/eric_hauser_part_1_of_2/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"George (Gyorgi) Havas (1929-2012) was born in Mukacheve, Czechoslovakia (today Ukraine). He experienced the Hungarian take-over of his town in late-1938, after the Germans were given the Sudetenland and arranged the award of land to Hungary. Havas was transported to Auschwitz on 15 May 1944, and then on to Mauthausen and then to Ebensee, where he spent one year prior to liberation. His father was a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz who perished in the October 1944 uprising. George Havas worked in the notorious tunnels at Ebensee. He lost his brother and several friends in the Ebensee camp. Only 16 when he was liberated, Havas was featured in some of the photos of the camp taken when the Americans arrived. See, for example, image 76788, at the USHMM at https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa7325. He immigrated to the USA in 1947 and lived in Virginia prior to his death in 2012.
