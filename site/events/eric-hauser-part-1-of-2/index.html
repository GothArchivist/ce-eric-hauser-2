in the Polish-Ukrainian borderlands: total war, the collapse of empires, the Bolshevik revolution, pogroms, the rise of fascism, more war, and the Holocaust. They could not have imagined the end of their family and of Jewish life as they knew it in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Only Isaak would survive to bear witness to what happened. In 1943, Isaak’s mother Liebe (b. 1885), his father Moses (b. 1885) and his younger siblings Hilda (b. 1910) and Aron (b. 1914) were all murdered. The details of their deaths are not known. Isak surmises that they died in the Janowska camp in the western region of Ukraine, known as Galicia, near its capital city of Lwów. They may also have been deported from that camp to the Nazi gassing centers of Belzec or Sobibor in Poland. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Isaak, who adopted the American name Eric when he immigrated to the United States in October 1949, gave his testimony to the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies in April 1985.  Recorded near his home in Rego Park, NY, the video is among the most important documents of the Holocaust in western Ukraine. Eric’s memories are vivid and detailed. He was a keen observer of events, remembering the names of perpetrators, Jewish colleagues, Polish workers, and Ukrainian policemen. He identified the precise locations of crimes and quoted the harsh words of Nazi killers. He recounted the last conversations he had with his family members. He managed to preserve important artifacts of his past, such as his identification papers, his worker’s badge, and his first written testimony, given in 1947 in Munich, Germany at the Office of Liberated Jews. Eric came prepared to the 1985 interview and as he spoke, he picked up these precious items from his past to prove that the Holocaust happened. His recorded testimony is empirically valuable. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;There are other dimensions of Hauser’s narrative that one might call performative, metaphorical, psychological, as well as historical.  These aspects refer to the survivor’s style, tone, emotions, and body language. When he references his knowledge of postwar trials, memorials, gatherings, and books on the Holocaust, he situates his own biography within the emerging phenomenon of Holocaust consciousness, within the community of survivors as moral witnesses, and life in contemporary America. In the recording, one can occasionally hear the background sounds of urban life while Eric describes the horrors he saw and endured decades ago in provincial Ukraine. The coincidental sounds do not detract; rather, they serve as a present-day contrast to Eric’s past, and when he pauses to regain his composure, looks downward, exhales, shakes his head, clears his throat, or wipes his eyes, viewers are reminded that despite the distance of forty years from the events and places, it is impossible for survivors to overcome or fully suppress what happened.   Indeed, one could focus exclusively on Hauser’s tearful breaks, many of them, in Lawrence Langer’s words “frozen moments of anguish,” as traumatic markers in his narrative. As Hauser stated at the end of his interview: ‘I cannot collect myself sometimes so well. One is overcome.” &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Summary of Eric Hauser’s Prewar and Wartime Biography&quot;],&quot;textSize&quot;:[0,&quot;heading-two&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Located about 20 miles southeast of Lwów, Eric’s hometown of Grodek Jagiellonski had a Jewish population of about 3,600 persons, or 30% of the inhabitants. Eric’s family was well-to-do and some were prominent members of the community. His father Moses had his own business as a building contractor and lender, issuing mortgages to other Jews. His mother’s father was a leader in the Jewish community. Like other Jews in Galicia, Eric acquired several languages, including Polish and German. He attended a Polish Catholic school, was named his class valedictorian in 1926, and was active with other youth in the socialist and leftist parties. Though Eric was more than qualified to attend a Polish university, the Polish polytechnical school did not admit Jews, so he relocated to Brno, Czechoslovakia to enroll in the technical university there. He earned a master’s degree in electrical and mechanical engineering in 1931, and then returned home and eventually found work in the nearby oil-fields industry as an engineer and assistant manager. His father Moses’s business continued to expand until he was able to build a large house in the city of Lwów, where the family lived in 1939. Eric’s siblings were also successful. His sister studied law and later owned a cinema; his brother was an accountant.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, both Germany and the Soviet Union invaded, conquered, and occupied Poland in September 1939. Eric’s boss fled to America after seizing the company’s funds, leaving Eric to manage some 220 employees with no cash to pay them. As German forces approached the oil fields in western Poland where Eric worked, he refused to sabotage the wells and equipment, and instead fled to the city of Lwów, which had been renamed Lviv and incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as part of the Russian-dominated Soviet Union. There, he briefly joined his family, and met then married his wife, Luise Finkler (1911-1999). Unable to secure a job in Lviv, he left the city with Luise to the oil town of Borislav (Boryslaw), which had a large population of 13,000 Jews. There, he managed the power plant’s department of mechanical and electrical engineering. Luise did administrative work in the office.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Shortly after the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), Hitler’s Seventeenth Army occupied Boryslaw on July 1, 1941. With local collaborators, German military officers organized a pogrom, murdering about 350 Jews. According to historian Piotr Wrobel’s analysis of Polish and Ukrainian testimonies, local Ukrainians in the militia and relatives of Ukrainians slain in the local prison by the retreating Russian NKVD officers, brought Jewish men to the prison to recover and clean the bodies of the Ukrainian prisoners, acting on instructions from the German military occupiers. Ukrainian peasants also appeared at the scene carrying axes and pitchforks. The killing was carried out by a combined force of German soldiers with local Ukrainians and the numerous Poles who resided in Boryslaw. This pogrom was followed by a series of mass shootings carried out by Himmler’s Schutzpolizei as the Germans undertook to annihilate the Jewish population while temporarily sparing some Jewish laborers who were needed in the region’s oil industry.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Eric and Luise managed to flee and hide during the round ups and massacres, enduring days in a flooded basement. Eric helped to construct a secret tunnel where they also hid with other Jews. In November 1942 the Germans established a forced labor camp for the remaining 1,470 Jewish laborers assigned to the Carpathian Oil Corporation (Karpathen Oel Aktiengesellschaft). Eric received a special “R” badge identifying him as an essential armaments worker (Rüstungsarbeiter), which also gave him privileges such as the ability to move around the town, interact with non-Jews outside the camp barracks, and observe what was happening as a whole to the Jewish community. There were at least five waves of mass shootings and deportations from Boryslaw between July 1941 and June 1943. Eric and Luise escaped the forced labor camp in late spring 1944, and managed to survive until Boryslaw was liberated by the Soviet Red Army on August 7, 1944. They traveled back to Lviv, where Eric’s family had been forced from the ghetto into the Janowska labor camp, which was the largest concentration camp in Ukraine as well as a transit camp for Jews sent to the gassing centers of Belzec and Sobibor. Eric believed that his family was killed there. While searching for them there, he found a metal bowl that prisoners ate from and kept it as a memory of his missing family. As prewar Polish citizens, Eric and Luise were not forced to remain in the Soviet Union. Seeing no future in Poland as Jews, they decided to head west and settled in the American occupation zone in Bavaria, Germany, where most of the Jewish survivors resided (more specifically, in Munich and its nearby displaced persons camps of Feldafing and Foehrenwald). They immigrated to the United States in October 1949.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;What is historically significant in Hauser’s testimony?&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hauser’s testimony interweaves many rich and significant themes in Holocaust history.

I have chosen these facets because they are unique to his experience, because of the manner in which he recounts them, and because they cover subject areas that are often overlooked or underappreciated in Holocaust studies. First, one should listen closely when survivors state explicitly and without prompting the reason for giving the interview. Hauser was clear about why he agreed to speak. He argued that not enough was known about what historians would later dub “the double occupation,” the Soviet crimes that preceded the Germans’ arrival and the entanglement of Nazism and Stalinism in these borderlands of the two empires. Second, paying attention to the amount of time devoted to certain topics also indicates what Hauser wished to emphasize and tell us. His pursuit of justice extended into the postwar period, when he discussed the West German trial of his tormenters. What was the experience of Jewish survivors who were called to testify, to return to Germany and relive their pasts in a courtroom setting among the perpetrators? Third, drawing from the rich literature on testimony analysis by scholars such as Lawrence Langer and Henry Greenspan, we can see in Hauser’s recounting those frozen moments of anguish, when he is overcome emotionally. What is he speaking about when those moments arise? Do those difficult, unspeakable experiences and memories give us another view into the Holocaust and the resounding impact of genocide on an individual survivor?  &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The Double Occupation&quot;],&quot;textSize&quot;:[0,&quot;heading-two&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;About fifteen minutes into Hauser’s interview, he states emphatically why he agreed to be recorded. Usually survivors are not as explicit: at the end of an interview, an interviewee might ask about lessons of the Holocaust, and the survivor might add a few sentences about the need to speak on behalf of murdered relatives, to educate future generations, to counter denial, or to prevent future genocides. But in the first part of the interview, as Hauser begins to explain what everyday life was like when the Second World War began and the Soviets occupied his hometown in September 1939, he stops and asserts: “The reason I do this interview only, I would like to show that the Russians broke our spirit. In a way, they’re—well, the Germans killed us physically. [00:15:11.81] But in a way, the Russians killed us mentally. They broke our spirit. They converted us from normal human beings who have some ambitions of hope into ants which go around all day long and look for food. “ [00:15:28.42].&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Indeed, he dedicates nearly a third of his interview to the evils of Stalinism and the degradations and deprivations of the Soviet terror, ironically termed in his words as the Soviet “cure.” First the Russians seized their home and stole their personal belongings. Then they subjected them to slave-labor like working conditions with demoralizing regulations that stripped them of basic freedoms and rights. In this “continuous struggle, they [the Russians] broke us so deeply and so completely that when Hitler later came, he had it very easy with us.” [00:18:39.460]. Then Hauser’s interview continues for another hour and as he starts to briefly cover his postwar experiences, leading to the end of his story, he stops and reiterates: “My reason for appearance today is I wanted to make sure—I don’t know if I did—to stress the point that we should have resisted much more strongly than we did. And we didn’t because the Russians have conditioned it to us. The Russians, with their preceding occupation, have changed us into a bunch of low animals. I don’t know, probably lower than rats.” [00:21:18:19].&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In Hauser’s lifetime, Ukraine and Poland became the crucible of Nazism and Stalinism, certainly its crossroads. Ukraine experienced two genocides, one under Stalin in 1932-33, known in Ukrainian as the Holodomor, a man-made terror-famine; and one in Hitler’s war and the Holocaust, 1939-1945. In addition, decades of Russian and then Soviet imperial rule and economic exploitation had destroyed Ukrainian attempts for independence, as well as the cultural life of non-Russians in Ukraine including historic Jewish orthodox communities in the former Pale of Settlement. Many Jews had emigrated before the First World War, but for Jews who had survived or recalled the pogroms of the late 19th century, then experienced the pogroms accompanying the Bolshevik revolution, home was an unstable, violent place and the future was uncertain. In fact, one out of every four murdered Jewish victims of the Holocaust resided in the territory of Ukraine (today’s borders). Thus, the survival rates were among the lowest in Nazi-occupied Europe. As we learn from Hauser’s searing account, the Jews were caught in the crosshairs of these two regimes as well as the interethnic antisemitic violence of the Poles and Ukrainians who competed for their own territorial claims and saw the Jewish minority as an outsider and threat. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;There is vast academic literature on the comparative histories of Hitler and Stalin as two totalitarian regimes. From the moment the world was shocked to learn that Hitler and Stalin had joined forces to destroy and occupy Poland, thus starting World War II in late August 1939, observers and analysts puzzled at the relationship between the two regimes, and of course feared for the future of Europe. After the war, western scholars compared the two terror systems, their ideologies of communism and fascism, and their records of mass murder.  Conservative West German historians led by Ernst Nolte and Andreas Hillgruber went too far in the late 1980s when they diminished the uniqueness of the Holocaust and whitewashed Germany’s past by trying to equate the crimes of Nazi Germany with those of the Allies, focusing on the mass expulsions of ethnic Germans and Stalin’s terror, even arguing that Hitler’s aggression was an act of defense, and that he launched a justifiable war to stem the spread of communism in Europe. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;With the collapse of the Soviet Union, which spurred the growth of Holocaust studies in the 1990s, scholars were able to access the mass murder sites and local archives, reconstructing events from the ground up in small towns of eastern Europe, collecting testimony from eyewitnesses, and discovering the heinous history of local collaboration and antisemitic violence, which had been suppressed in official Soviet histories.  Sociologist Jan Gross, who had written pioneering studies on the plight of Poles during the war, published a powerful account of one town, Jedwabne, Poland in which he documented that local Poles had organized and carried out the mass murder of their Jewish neighbors, massacring almost half the population of their hometown. As we learn in Hauser’s account, the wave of pogroms in the summer of 1941 extended beyond Jedwabne across the Nazi-Soviet border where Poles, Ukrainians, ethnic and Germans targeted Jews in acts of anti-Soviet rage. Similar events occurred in the Baltic states and in Romania.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Indeed, western Ukraine saw some of the most widespread violence, not only in the region’s capital of Lviv, but also across the villages and towns extending eastward and southward.  At least fifty-eight Jewish communities were struck by pogroms in summer 1941. Historian Dieter Pohl estimates that in other parts of eastern Galicia more than 12,000 Jews died in pogroms, the largest occurring in Lviv where approximately 3,000 to 4,000 Jews were brutally murdered between 30 June and 25 July 1941.  As was the case in nearby Stanyslaviv (Ivano-Frankivsk), Zolochiv, Drohobych, Buchach, and Ternopil’, in Lviv the Jews were blamed for the Soviets’ mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners and others whose mutilated remains were found in NKVD jails.  The Soviets had pursued a policy of mass murder of political prisoners during the retreat. The new German occupiers and their Ukrainian allies in the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists were both determined to clear Ukraine of Jews who were branded Bolsheviks, and to this end organized antisemitic ‘retaliation’ campaigns.  The fact that Jews, Russians, and Poles were also victims of NKVD atrocities in Galicia and Volhynia was conveniently suppressed. Instead, all the evils associated with Bolshevism were projected on the Jews, seen as both an inferior race and a threatening Other.  Typically, Jewish men were forced to exhume bodies of prisoners killed by the Soviets; in some cases, they had to wash the corpses and dig the graves to prepare them for a religious burial. While the Jews carried out these gruesome tasks, the local members of the population were allowed to vent their rage about the despised Soviet system, beating Jews with clubs, rods, and other blunt instruments. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Another survivor of Boryslaw, Anna Dichter, explained that the Germans arrived on 1 July 1941, and the pogrom started on 3 July: “My father and I were forced to wash the bodies of prisoners slain by the NKVD. My father had to stay overnight in the prison; Ukrainians burned his body with sulphuric acid and ended up killing 400 Jews in those days. Killing them with sticks and stones, not with guns.”  Jozef Lipman, also from Boryslaw, stated that “the Germans gave the Ukrainians a free hand to take revenge on the Jews . . . The Rusyns descended from the mountains [the Carpathians] and started brutal massacres...using metal rods and sticks with nails . . . our family was in hiding, neighbors saved us.”&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;  &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;According to Philip Friedman, who was a survivor of the Holocaust in Galicia, as well as a pioneering historian, the involvement of Ukrainians cut across class, educational, generational, and political lines. Individuals acted with different motives and varying aims, which converged spontaneously or was cleverly harnessed by the Nazi occupiers. News that actions against Jews would occur in the towns prompted peasants to arrive in town with carts to load up the plunder. Memory of or rumors about pogroms in the First World War provided onlookers and participants in 1941 with a precedent, a pattern of response. But the stereotype of the rapacious Ukrainian peasant distorts the reality and obscures culpability. Ukrainian priests, judges, and school inspectors petitioned the German authorities to start anti-Jewish measures. Antisemitic propaganda entered the school curricula. In Zbarazh, ‘Ukrainian secondary-school students marched singing through the streets, and on to the Jewish cemetery, where they destroyed the tombstones.”  Nor was the organization and implementation of the violence strictly “men’s business.” Women were among the assailants and organizers, like the daughter of a prominent attorney in Zolochiv. All sections of society participated in the pogroms: the educated and uneducated, the urban and rural, lower and middle class, religious and secular, young and old. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hauser’s testimony corroborates this history of violence while adding another victim group to the story. The NKVD prison in Boryslaw did not contain so-called political prisoners; it contained Polish children. On May 3, 1941, about two months before the Germans arrived, two hundred Polish children dressed in national costumes gathered to celebrate Poland’s Independence Day. They were singing anthems and polka dancing, but these types of public events promoting Polish nationalism were forbidden by the Soviets. So these youth (according to Hauser, 12-16 years old) were arrested, and brought by trucks to the prison. Rumors spread that one of the truckdrivers who brought them to the prison was a Jewish man who was laughing and “made a snide remark.” According to Hauser, this incensed the population and “a cry went out all over the city of Boryslaw, the Jews have killed our children. And the Ukrainians, who were Jew haters to begin with [sic], united with the Polish parents.” Jews were rounded up, forced “to crawl on their knees and kiss their [the Polish children’s] dead bodies and beg forgiveness. And then they were beaten to death with lead pipes and iron pipes.” Hauser recalled that a few Ukrainians rescued Jews, including the Rabbi who was pulled out of the “melee.” This was the same night that Hauser lost 30 members of his family. Seen from the ground level in Boryslaw, it is clear that, as Hauser relates in his account of the Soviet murder of the Polish children followed by the pogrom, the Soviet occupation laid the groundwork for the Nazis in fostering more violent antisemitism. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;image&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/christy_tomecek_yale_edu/Documents/AVAnnotatePictures/Picture1.jpg&quot;],&quot;caption&quot;:[0,&quot;Map of Eastern Galicia, reproduced with permission from IUP from Frank Golczewski, ‘Shades of Grey: Reflections on Jewish-Ukrainian and German-Ukrainian Relations in Galicia’, in The Shoah in Ukraine: History, Testimony, Memorialization, ed.

Indeed, the pogroms may have emboldened Nazi leaders who realized that they could find plenty of support on the ground for their own more extreme genocidal campaign of a “Final Solution.” Reichsführer of the SS-police Heinrich Himmler unleashed his motorized shooting squads and deployed mobile gas vans to murder Jews and Soviet POWs across the Soviet Union, then commissioned architects and gassing experts to construct the first stationary killing centers in Nazi-occupied Poland. Hauser’s region of western Ukraine fell within the borders of Nazi-occupied Poland (known as the General Government), as did the Sobibor, Treblinka, and Belzec camps. Of the more than 540,000 Jews in Hauser’s region, about 200,000 were killed in or near their hometowns in pogroms, mass shootings, and smaller massacres in or near ghettos and labor camps. The remainder, about 345,000, were deported and gassed immediately, mostly at Belzec.  Hauser’s story combines these two histories of the Holocaust – murder by bullets, and the industrialized murders in the camps.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In Holocaust studies, scholars meticulously trace the radicalization of Nazi anti-Jewish measures leading to Auschwitz, starting with Hitler’s rule in 1933. But for the inhabitants of Boryslaw and elsewhere in this borderland of double occupation, the radicalization began with the arrival of the Soviets in 1939, and for Hauser this first blow broke his family’s spirit. When the Nazis followed in 1941, his family did not flee, they stayed home, resigned to their fate. Hauser witnessed this, refused to succumb and endeavored to explain the loss of his extended family in Boryslaw as part of this continuum of terror that Jews experienced in this region. In many ways Hauser’s account anticipated a later comparative approach to the two regimes operating in what Timothy Snyder called the Molotov-Ribbentrop zone. In Snyder’s Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin (2010), he identified more varied and complex entanglements of the two regimes, and focused on the collapsed states in the borderlands and their vulnerable populations, stressing how Stalin’s rule paved the way for Hitler’s. After all, when Stalin’s henchmen arrived in Boryslaw in 1939, they brought with them Soviet systems of mass pillaging, deportation, forced labor and murder, which the Nazis surpassed in scope and scale during the Second World War. In Snyder’s history of the Holocaust, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Black Earth&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, he devoted a chapter to the “Double Occupation,” stressing the paradoxical vulnerabilities of the Jewish minority, and quoting a Galician Jew’s recollections of the time:&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;block-quote&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;[…] fathers of families had become like loosely hanging limbs.

He described his father as “more dead than alive” when the Nazis arrived. During and after the war, witnesses to the Holocaust described Jews as going to their deaths like sheep to the slaughter. This perception allowed Germans and other bystanders to justify the murder as inevitable, or even correct. After all, in the perpetrator’s mind, if the Jews accepted their own murder, then perhaps this resignation was an admission of their guilt, weakness, or inferiority. This perception of passivity rallied Jews like Abba Kovner, who issued a 1942 manifesto calling for armed resistance in the Vilna ghetto titled \&quot;Let us not go like lambs to the slaughter!\&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hauser does not explicitly pose the problematic question, why didn’t they resist, but he answers it. Another survivor from the region, Leon Wells, stated in his testimony in the Fortunoff Archive that such a question is immoral in the same way that we would not ask a rape victim why she didn’t resist. Hauser gives us the view of the victim who has been overwhelmed, worn down by the persecution and a sense of hopelessness, who like a torture victim has lost trust in the world and humanity.  Indeed, countless Jews opted for suicide, being both resigned to and reclaiming their bodily autonomy.  Hauser was among the few witnesses (especially prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union) to describe to western audiences how the Soviet system broke their spirits and consequently weakened their ability to resist and survive the Nazi occupation. It is also a reminder that expecting or assuming victims can resist obfuscates the actual circumstances and contexts that Jews found themselves in, as is the case with other victims of genocide and torture who are rendered utterly powerless and helpless. Thus, comparing the two regimes side-by-side and trying to determine which one was worse misses the explanatory dynamic of the two overlapping systems of occupation, as a causal factor in the escalation to genocide, and as double blow of occupation that left the Jewish population most vulnerable.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Survivors in the West German Courtroom&quot;],&quot;textSize&quot;:[0,&quot;heading-two&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;A second prominent and under-researched theme in Hauser’s testimony is the postwar experience of Holocaust survivors in German trials against Nazi perpetrators. During and after the Holocaust, Jewish lawyers and historians including Raphael Lemkin, Simon Wiesenthal, and Philip Friedman collected evidence and documentation that might be used in trials against their tormentors and killers.  The Allies formally committed to punish Nazi perpetrators when Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin signed the Moscow Declaration of German Atrocities in October 1943, leading to the establishment of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945-46, and to thousands of investigations and trials across Europe in each country’s national courts. Because Hauser had repeated contact with the Jewish militia and German police officials, he witnessed their sadistic acts and endeavored to record their names and describe their backgrounds. When he settled temporarily in Munich, the center of Jewish life in the American occupation zone, he found himself among an active survivor community that was - like him - determined to avenge the murder of loved ones in the courts. Besides creating a historical record of the Holocaust and a memorial to their murdered relatives, these documentarians were eager to collect incriminating statements and materials in the pursuit of justice. This was the motivation for Hauser and his wife when they signed and submitted their affidavits in the legal department of the Office of Liberated Jews in Munich in March 1947. A similar spirit animated his Fortunoff interview decades later, when he held up the book, Antworte, Mensch! [Answer, Human!] by Renate Reinke (Bremen, 1968). &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;image&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/christy_tomecek_yale_edu/Documents/AVAnnotatePictures/Picture2.jpg&quot;],&quot;caption&quot;:[0,&quot;Hauser holds the book Antworte Mensch, 00:17:24.52. &quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hauser holds the book Antworte Mensch, 00:17:24.52. &quot;],&quot;textSize&quot;:[0,&quot;small&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hauser explains why he brought this German book to his interview. It is a rare publication about a West German trial held in Bremen in the mid-1960s. Hauser knew the defendants as former perpetrators in Ukraine. But perhaps more interesting to Hauser was the book’s author, Renate Reinke. She was the daughter of a former Gestapo chief in Innsbruck and SS officer active in Rowno/Rivne Ukraine. After the war, her parents committed suicide. Morally outraged about her father’s SS past and post-war German silence about the Holocaust, Reinke decided to attend the trial of another mass murderer active in western Ukraine, Friedrich Hildebrand, in order to educate the public and support the Jewish survivors who returned for the trial. She published newspaper articles that were sympathetic to the Jewish witnesses appearing before the court. As Hauser relates, Reinke also joined the Bremen German community, hosting 200 survivors who traveled from 13 different cities around the world to testify. She may have been inspired by Hannah Arendt’s journalistic coverage of the Eichmann trial in 1961, in which Jewish survivors’ testimony played a central role in the proceedings in Jerusalem.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In Hauser’s summary of what happened in Bremen, he takes the view of the Jewish witnesses who “couldn’t speak very well German. Many of them had no place where to stay. Many of them were confused and afraid.” In the courtroom they were subjected to harsh questioning about what they saw, and about their reliability as eyewitnesses. The defense attorney challenged them: “did you see how he put the pistol to the Jew’s head?” Hauser was incensed by such questions, asking, “who could see it? Who could dare? Supposedly, you were hidden somewhere in a spot where you could look out. Would you dare to look the German in the eyes as he was shooting?” Hauser surmises that Hildebrand’s skewed sentencing (he received life in prison for murdering 3 Jews, and a seven-year sentence for assisting in the murder of at least 1750 Jews) was due to the fact that these survivor witnesses recognized Hildebrand as the executioner of the camp liquidations, but could not testify that they saw him directly kill a Jewish person or heard him order such a killing.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In the postwar decades leading up to the Bremen trial, West Germans had investigated some 30,000 former Nazis, and convicted 155 of them for murder. According to a leading Jewish prosecutor in Frankfurt, Fritz Bauer, the investigations were “incidental,” often initiated by survivors who recognized Nazis in public places. Yet those initial identifications often led nowhere. Most Germans wanted to move on after the Nuremberg Trials. The German legal code, going back to 1871, was designed for prosecuting homicide and not genocide, and the postwar judiciary was conservative and populated by many former Nazis. They refrained from reforming the code and from severely punishing Nazis, who were seen as no longer a threat to society. Yet thousands of survivors from around the world presented themselves as willing witnesses despite the hardship and despite the often-hostile environments in the courts, which privileged ‘objective” German documents over “subjective’ victim testimony.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Another Boryslaw survivor, Mark K., is featured in Reinke’s book and was also interviewed by Fortunoff. It is possible that Eric Hauser knew Mark K. They both emigrated to the US and settled in New York, and Hauser mentioned at the end of his interview that he participated in annual commemoration ceremonies on Long Island and met with other survivors from Boryslaw. In Mark’s interview he also reads from Reinke’s book and describes what it was like to testify in the Bremen court, admitting that he was afraid to see Hildebrand because he thought the Nazi perpetrator might hurt him. When Mark testified, he was visibly nervous. His German was good, but he was not able to express himself clearly enough. The attorneys pressed him to be more precise about how Hildebrand stabbed his father and asked him if he saw it.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In this courtroom and other trials, survivors were tested about their knowledge of the events, the exact crime scene locations, the names, backgrounds, ranks, uniforms and affiliations of the killers, and the differences between German organizations such as the Gestapo and the SS. They had to confront the murderers of their family members back in Germany, though most did not wish to return there. Furthermore, the German defendant usually insisted that he was innocent of the charges, claimed he was not at the crime scenes, and that he did not issue orders to kill. Another common approach among the accused Germans was to present the selection of one Jewish specialist to serve their needs during the war as an act of rescue, while suppressing the fact that the Jewish tailor, craftsman, or dentist, was later murdered with their authorization. In West Germany, Nazis were still on the bench and remained in the ranks of the local police and government. The visits to West Germany might be prolonged, as trials lasted months and years. This was a costly, emotional disruption to the Jewish survivors’ lives and their families.  While the Bremen German community showed exceptional hospitality for the several dozens of Jews it hosted during the Hildebrand trial, there is evidence from other trials of more hostile attitudes. Concentration camp survivors were harassed by German spectators at the Nuremberg Trials in 1947-48, and leading Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal and Jewish prosecutor Fritz Bauer, active in Germany and Austria, received death threats throughout their careers.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Why didn’t Hauser testify in Bremen? In 1947, he appeared with his wife at the legal department of the Office of the Liberated Jews in Munich. They gave formal depositions regarding what had happened in Boryslaw as part of the court proceedings against the police in Boryslaw and against the Gestapo in neighboring Drohobych. After providing eight pages of horrific descriptions of the sadism of the German police, Hauser asked: “One should now explain how could all what was described be seen. Many of us, who were tied to the oil industry and who on demands of the job had to be able to walk around the oil fields, warehouses etc., received passes. I had such a pass, and the Germans made no secret of their procedures in Boryslaw.” Then he closed: “We the survivors of the Boryslaw camp and Ghetto we ask to be called as witnesses before the court proceedings for Wuepper and consortes.”&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;It is likely that Hauser discussed the 1967-68 Bremen trial within his survivor community of Galician Jews, and the German prosecutors would have worked through the German consulate in New York City and Jewish organizations to identify and interview possible witnesses. Hauser may have considered participating. Boryslaw survivor Mark K. explained that he had read about the upcoming trial in the New York Times and decided to present himself as a witness. He brought his wife and 18-year-old daughter with him. Although he was terrified about returning to Germany, he was determined to contribute to the trial, and as he said, speak from his soul the truth of what happened. Considering the challenges that survivors faced in the postwar German courtroom, it is understandable that Eric did not participate, though there may have been other reasons as well. He was not asked about this in the interview and did not offer information. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Frozen Moments of Anguish&quot;],&quot;textSize&quot;:[0,&quot;heading-two&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;There are myriad ways to interpret testimonies, especially the ones that we can see and hear. As a living source of the past, the storyteller communicates information laden with emotion. We can observe the utterances, facial expressions, wiping of tears, looking down or away, and listen to the changes in the tone and volume of his voice. Different gestures and expressions suggest where the victim of trauma may still be experiencing the past in an acutely painful and shattering way. This last part of my analysis will focus on Hauser’s emotions and the performative aspects of his recounting.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Nearly all survivor testimonies follow a structured form of autobiography, and the interviewer’s role is often to maintain this narrative order of life before the Holocaust, during, and after. Most survivors focus on the period of the Holocaust and devote less time to the aftermath; they are encouraged to do so since the war years defined them as Holocaust survivors, and the efforts of museums and archives concentrate on that history. Like Hauser, survivors come to the interview intending to tell certain stories about what was done to them, their families and other victims. Perhaps they arrive hopeful that recounting these extreme horrors will alleviate their own suffering, honor their kin, and bring meaning and purpose to their lives and future generations of viewers and students. Yet to the observer, the interview rarely seems to be cathartic in the end. This is what literary scholar Lawrence Langer concluded after systematically researching and analyzing the testimonies in the Fortunoff Archive, as well as interviewing many of the survivors in the collection.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Instead, as Hauser demonstrates, the most powerful recollections that he endeavors to share remain his most open-ended ones, suspended in confusion and moral outrage, and persistently lodged in his senses. First Hauser reveals his family’s inability to face or resist the obvious threats to their lives. He relates how his father honorably paid all his debts believing that “his worth is as good as gold. While the bombs were falling, he paid his debts.” Hauser states this while shaking head in disbelief. He pauses, gets choked up, looks down, scratches his chin, and then smiles ironically. After recounting the brutalization of the Poles against their Jewish neighbors, Hauser prepares to speak about the betrayal of Jews who sacrificed and tortured their own relatives and colleagues. He saw a Jewish militiaman bring his own mother to the collecting point and openly rape a Jewish girl. While Hauser is speaking, he lifts up his papers and hides his face, wipes his eyes with a handkerchief, and pauses, looking down in shame. And then in another recollection of the loss of his family in the first wave of pogroms and massive violence against the Jews in Boryslaw, Hauser describes his last moment with them: “I—I went in. My family was there. I told them disperse. There is something vicious going on. They said no. We sit together. We feel better when we sit together. So, they sat together. And they all died together. I ran away and I hid out.” Hauser falls silent. He had “escaped by the breath of a hair” yet “lost 30 people of close family that night.” [00:29:03.23] How could it be that he was among the sole survivors of his entire family? This is another immoral question. Survivors suffered with it in the aftermath, and psychologists have termed it ‘survivor’s guilt’. Of course, the Jewish victims were not guilty of a crime and could not have saved their families from the overwhelming assault. However, many suffered this symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder, and some succumbed to suicide even decades after the war.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In Hauser’s determination to recount the relentless cruelty of the Germans, he speaks the violent German phrases that still resound in his ears. For example, one of Hauser’s fellow Jewish workers, a drillmaster named Hartman, had tried to escape by fleeing from a window, from which he fell and injured himself. As he lay moaning on the ground below, German civilians including girls and boys in the Nazi Party’s youth movements, gathered there along with SS officers. According to Hauser, one of the officers handed his pistol to a youngster and ordered the 12- or 13-year-old boy to “finish off this Jew!” -- in German slang, “Leg ihn um!” But the kid shuddered and was afraid, and the other SS man tried to protect him, saying “leave the kid in peace” [Lass den Jungen zu ruhe]. “No,” the other insisted, “the boy should learn.” Hauser became incensed, “he should learn how to kill defenseless people—learning, you know? “’Soll er lernen,’ it sounds in my ears.” [00:45:11.39] Here the German language triggers traumatic memories, inflecting Hauser’s description of what happened in a more precise and acutely painful way. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Conclusion&quot;],&quot;textSize&quot;:[0,&quot;heading-two&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;In his autobiography, Raphael Lemkin, who established the study and struggle against genocide, wrote that “the function of memory is not only to register past events but to stimulate human conscience.”  For decades we have adopted this Lemkin logic: remembering the Holocaust will spur awareness of other genocides, and aid in halting them if they are ongoing. Survivor and professor emeritus of German literature, Ruth Klüger, author of Still Alive, one of the most powerful Holocaust-related memoirs ever published, scoffed at the notion of deriving lessons from places such as Auschwitz-Birkenau where she was a prisoner with her mother: “Auschwitz was no instructional institution, like the University of Göttingen . . . . You learned nothing there, and least of all humanity and tolerance.”  &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;What can one learn from a glimpse into hell, she asked? Indeed, that “glimpse into hell” is the special knowledge (and burden) that survivors such as Eric Hauser carry with them. As Elie Wiesel put it: &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;block-quote&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;It all comes down to this for me: We discovered absolute Evil. And not absolute Good. So, what can we do for the young people who are kind enough to read what we have written or to listen to us, so that they won’t fall into despair? How can we go about telling them that is it nonetheless given to man to thirst for the absolute in Good and not only in Evil. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Wiesel agreed with another victim, Jorge Semprún who observed that bearing witness to absolute Evil took an emotional toll on his life but was a necessary “pedagogical rite” that one could not abrogate. These eminent survivors struggled to turn their encounters with the worst into revelations about what is good and life affirming. Even Klüger, who rejected the notion of lessons from Auschwitz, wrote about the profound love of her mother and the solidarity of women who saved her.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As public figures and spokespersons in their publications, speeches and teaching, survivor witnesses rose in stature to become society’s moral authorities in discussions of good and evil, genocide prevention and memorialization. In comparison, Hauser and the tens of thousands of other victims in the archives left us with one taped or written account of their lives. They did not produce a polished speech or a literary masterpiece; and Hauser does not aim to interpret what happened and provide future generations with lessons. Hauser resists ending his interview chronologically with calls for prevention. In the last minutes he states, “I must, I would like to tell this story” and reverts back to his wartime in Boryslaw to describe a strong Jewish man, an individual who was legendary in his looks, athleticism, bravery and was captured and “fiercely beaten.” The interview is ending and yet Hauser does not seem to be able to fully return to the present, conceding, “I cannot collect myself sometimes so well. One is overcome.” Sensing the end of his chance to tell more stories, perhaps knowing that he left some out or that he could have told more, he turns to the interviewer to make sure she has copies of his 1947 written testimony. He has regained his composure but there is no closure. He sits up, pulls back from his documents and other presentation items on the table between him and the interviewer. For the moment the items seemed to have lost their power since their evidentiary purpose has been served. The session is over, and the interviewee is left questioning not only how he did, if he remembered things correctly, if he made the points and told the stories that he aimed to, but also if his uncontrollable emotional anguish diminished his ability to convey what happened, and to be believed. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;created_at&quot;:[0,&quot;2026-02-22T19:30:52.070Z&quot;],&quot;created_by&quot;:[0,&quot;GothArchivist&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Eric Hauser Critical Edition 2&quot;],&quot;updated_at&quot;:[0,&quot;2026-02-23T01:12:25.209Z&quot;],&quot;updated_by&quot;:[0,&quot;GothArchivist&quot;],&quot;autogenerate&quot;:[0,{&quot;enabled&quot;:[0,true],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;home&quot;]}]}],&quot;filePath&quot;:[0,&quot;src/content/pages/cc9f2af8-ead5-4efa-a5e2-77ca6906b2ed.json&quot;],&quot;digest&quot;:[0,&quot;1b274a45228ce657&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;pages&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;51536381-73d7-4e24-abbb-78bacc6b8040&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;content&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;created_at&quot;:[0,&quot;2026-02-22T19:33:02.139Z&quot;],&quot;created_by&quot;:[0,&quot;GothArchivist&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Eric Hauser - Part 1 of 2&quot;],&quot;updated_at&quot;:[0,&quot;2026-02-22T19:33:02.139Z&quot;],&quot;updated_by&quot;:[0,&quot;GothArchivist&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;eric-hauser-part-1-of-2&quot;],&quot;autogenerate&quot;:[0,{&quot;enabled&quot;:[0,true],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;event&quot;],&quot;type_id&quot;:[0,&quot;ef236f63-1933-404c-8b05-8e35dbcd3b99&quot;]}]}],&quot;filePath&quot;:[0,&quot;src/content/pages/51536381-73d7-4e24-abbb-78bacc6b8040.json&quot;],&quot;digest&quot;:[0,&quot;a82653de51c29558&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;pages&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;bc900120-3006-4c6e-858c-1a96ee229b7e&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;content&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;created_at&quot;:[0,&quot;2026-02-22T19:33:02.257Z&quot;],&quot;created_by&quot;:[0,&quot;GothArchivist&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Eric Hauser - Part 2 of 2&quot;],&quot;updated_at&quot;:[0,&quot;2026-02-22T19:33:02.257Z&quot;],&quot;updated_by&quot;:[0,&quot;GothArchivist&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;eric-hauser-part-2-of-2&quot;],&quot;autogenerate&quot;:[0,{&quot;enabled&quot;:[0,true],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;event&quot;],&quot;type_id&quot;:[0,&quot;f12b2191-1744-4dbd-8dd9-6f4d95e73aeb&quot;]}]}],&quot;filePath&quot;:[0,&quot;src/content/pages/bc900120-3006-4c6e-858c-1a96ee229b7e.json&quot;],&quot;digest&quot;:[0,&quot;cd3a4f10bdf9b876&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;pages&quot;]}]]],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;eric-hauser-part-1-of-2&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[7,&quot;https://gotharchivist.github.io/ce-eric-hauser-2/events/eric-hauser-part-1-of-2/&quot;],&quot;project&quot;:[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;project&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;project&quot;:[0,{&quot;github_org&quot;:[0,&quot;GothArchivist&quot;],&quot;is_private&quot;:[0,false],&quot;generate_pages_site&quot;:[0,true],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Eric Hauser Critical Edition 2&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Eric Hauser&#39;s Critical Edition by Wendy Lower, Claremont McKenna College. \n\nThe Critical Editions Series contextualizes Fortunoff Video testimonies in their historical time and place.

Sidney had married Shirley Levine (1917-1990) and they had a daughter, Phyllis, in 1943. U.S. draft policies in World War II were such that, with a wife and child, Sidney was not immediately drafted. The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, also known as the Burke–Wadsworth Act, enacted September 16, 1940, “was the first peacetime conscription in United States history. This Selective Service Act required that men who had reached their 21st birthday but had not yet reached their 36th birthday register with local draft boards. Later, when the U.S. entered World War II, all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 45th birthday were made subject to military service, and all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 65th birthday were required to register.… By the early summer of 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked the U.S. Congress to extend the term of duty for the draftees beyond twelve months to a total of thirty months, plus any additional time that he could deem necessary for national security…. After the United States entered World War II, amendments to the Selective Training and Service Act on December 20, 1941, made all men between the ages of 20 and 44 liable for military service, and required all men between the ages of 18 and 64 to register.… From October 1940 until March 1947, when the wartime Selective Training and Service Act expired after extensions by Congress, over 10,000,000 men were inducted.” More broadly, the U.S. federal government has turned to the draft six times in history (American Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts). Conscription came to an end only in 1973 when the United States Armed Forces became all-voluntary. See “Selective Training and the Selective Service Act of 1940, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Training_and_Service_Act_of_1940 (accessed 21 March 2022). From October 1940 until March 1947“49 million men had been registered, 36 million classified, and 10 million inducted.” See “Conscription in the United States” at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States (accessed 21 March 2022).&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;fd1bd43a-6e19-46d3-9997-3b7f0f441e73&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,156.808],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,189.19],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;2. A brief word on the facilities mentioned by Bruskin: “Armory Court,” one observer noted, “is a building of power. Located at the north end of Orange Street, right before East Rock Park, this ‘medieval castle’ stands out imposingly from the residential surroundings. Its hexagonal towers and battlements have an instantly recognizable silhouette, an homage to Romanesque architecture that creates a sense of security for the condominium complex that lies behind the large iron gate. While the owners of Armory Court have changed through the last century, the building has retained its present form for more than a hundred years. Built in 1906, it was used as a barracks and stable for the Troop A Cavalry, a part of the Connecticut National Guard. It remained in use by the military until 1970, when it was acquired by the former South Central Community College, which used the building’s powerful image to house their administration office building. After renovations in 1987, Armory Court assumed its present function - a condominium complex divided into small, single-family rowhouse apartments.” See (https://nhba.yale.edu/building?id=5e596a2ab5abb055a040dfc0 (accessed 21 March 2022) more detailed account of the Armory, with its rich material history, adds: “When the armory closed around 2009, and the City of New Haven gained possession, veterans from the 102nd Regiment removed a portrait of Sargent Stubby, the 102nd regiment’s famous war dog, as well as the furnishings and restaged the room for exhibit in the West Haven Veteran’s Museum and Learning Center circa 2010. 7 WPA murals feature the Foot Guards’ most famous lore: Benedict Arnold’s famous march to the New Haven Green to demand the keys to the powder house on the eve of the Revolution. Around 2010, original light fixtures and wood paneling were removed to Yale University, the West Haven Veterans Museum, and the new Foot Guard headquarters at the armory in Branford, Connecticut…. From the end of its construction in 1930 through 2009, the armory has served as a center for military preparations and disaster relief, and as a clubhouse for those serving. The building is also significant at the state level in the category of Social History as a host for large community, state, and regional celebrations and events over several decades. This includes New Haven’s African American activist community, who in the 1970s, continued to work for social and economic justice in the later years of the Civil Rights Movement.” See https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DECD/Historic-Preservation/06_About_SHPO/State-Review-Board/Dec-4-2020/New-Haven-Armory-NR.pdf&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;08117534-308c-45f8-8685-738ab4af7359&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,244.54],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,269.896],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;3.

As the Allies prepared an invasion of the Continent, hundreds of thousands of American soldiers were stationed in Great Britain. This sometimes resulted in friction, with the phrase ‘over-paid, over-sexed, and over-here’ becoming commonplace. In Bruskin’s case, the new father evidently was not interested in British women, but in making some money. His account relates how he sought to transact business, indeed, to ply his trade, while stationed abroad. While Bruskin’s wife had taken over his bike business back in New Haven, he still hoped to contribute to the family income while in the service. That he found time to entertain purchases indicates the relatively relaxed atmosphere prior to D-Day and the actual fighting against the Germans.

Omaha Beach proved the most contested and difficult of the five landing beaches for D-Day on 6 June 1944, with between 4,000 and 9,000 Allied casualties. The beach is about six miles wide and as the Allies landed some 34,000 troops that day (most delivered away from the planned locations), they came under heavy fire from the Germans and their allies. They eventually prevailed in the days that followed. The Allies removed the obstacles to amphibious landings, including taking out 250 massive steel “Belgian Gate” barricades and 11,000 beams used as anti-tank and anti-landing craft defenses. By the time Bruskin arrived at D-plus-30, Omaha Beach had become a transit center that facilitated the liberation of Normandy and then all of France. Infrastructure and logistics would prove crucial to the Allied victory.

For the history of the 80th Division, see the website regarding the 80 th Infantry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80th_Division_(United_States). On 5 August 1944, the 80th Infantry landed at Utah Beach and then fought its way across France until they ran out of gas at the river Seille. They later fought at the Battle of the Bulge, where they helped rescue the 101 st Airborne Division under siege in Bastogne. The 80 th Division crossed the Rhine on 27–28 March, near Mainz and subsequently fought in Kassel, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Nuremberg, among other locations. The U.S. Army’s 80th infantry division had a storied history during WWII as part of General George Patton’s Third Army and the division featured a notable branch of the Counterintelligence Corps, or CIC. The CIC had evolved from the Military Intelligence Service’s Counter Intelligence Branch. Utilizing information provided by the Office of Strategic Services, or OSS, which was another branch of the War Department and a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIC was tasked with “locating criminals, Nazi records, and looted property.” Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Plunder and Restitution&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2000), SR-218. Journalist Guy Walters notes of the CIC, “Originally established in August 1917 as the Corps of Intelligence Police, the fifty-strong unit ran counter-espionage operations in northern France toward the end of the First World War. Between the wars it underwent various mutations, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor it was renamed the CIC and authorized to recruit 1,026 non-commissioned officers. This was rapidly swelled to 4,431, with a provision for 543 officers. The men selected for the CIC were often expected to have some form of legal experience, although as the war went on this requirement was waived, and recruits were merely expected to have an adequate education, be of ‘good character,’ and loyal to the flag…. The CIC was not a haven for shirkers, however. Six of its units came ashore in Normandy on D-Day and counter-espionage work is not without its dangers.” Guy Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil: The Nazi War Criminals Who Escaped and the Quest to Bring Them to Justice&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (New York: Broadway Books, 2009), 63. Walters adds, “After the invasion [of Normandy] the principal role of the CIC detachments was to screen displaced persons, and to determine whether they were enemy agents or war criminals masquerading as civilians. By the time the Allies had entered Germany, the CIC’s role was to arrest Nazis and other Germans who represented a threat to the Allied forces. In addition to ‘normal’ counter-espionage work, the CIC had to secure Nazi party buildings in order to safeguard the documents they contained…. The British may have been envious of the resources the American Nazi-hunting units had at their disposal, but they were a little sniffy about their methods. ‘They were very gung-ho,’ recalled John Hodge, a captain in the British War Crimes Team; ‘they all had pistols and went ‘come on, let’s go get him!’” Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 63. Despite the enthusiasm of CIC personnel, they suffered from a shortage of translators. As one history of the organization notes, “The greatest single CIC procurement problem during the war was the difficulty in obtaining linguists who were qualified for CIC duty... As reports poured in to the Office of the Chief from tactical units throughout the world, all stressed the need for agents who could conduct interrogations in the native languages of the countries in which they were serving.” George Chalou, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Covert Warfare: The Counter Intelligence Corps in Action&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (New York: Garland, 1989), chapter 7 (no page numbers provided).

The CIC developed strategies not just for tracking but also interrogating Nazis and their allies. For all the swashbuckling stories of capturing fugitive Nazis, the CIC was a bureaucratic agency, with protocols and methods. It was policy to have the high-ranking subjects interrogated by the more senior personnel. Bruskin’s interaction with the most notorious Nazis and their spouses came mostly at the time of arrest, before the subjects were handed over and duly “processed,” or when he pulled guard duty.&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;2aa3f885-5d08-467a-b7e7-886b1f32be1c&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,587.03],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,618.28],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;8. The search for French Nazis and youths who had fought in the Wehrmacht could turn brutal. Scholars talk of ‘savage’ justice as the war ended, which at times involved immediate execution of those believed guilty, as well as more bureaucratic justice for those who collaborated (épuration sauvage and épuration legale). This was a French-led effort, but, as Bruskin noted, the Allies also pursued certain Vichy officials.

While most German troops who surrendered hoped it would be to the Americans (among the four major Allies), and gave up their arms without incident, there were exceptions.

Bruskin here speaks to the survival of German Jews, either due to being in a ‘mixed-marriage’ or as ‘U-boats.’ Even though the Nazis had made such marriages illegal as part of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, the law did not annul existing marriages. In 1933, there were about 35,000 mixed marriages in Germany and by 1939 there were about 20,000 (with the number dropping to 12,000 by the end of 1944). The decline was partly due to demographics, partly to Nazi authorities putting pressure on Christians to divorce Jewish spouses, and partly due to the genocide that occurred later in the war. For most of the Third Reich, the Jewish partners in a mixed marriage were considered ‘privileged,’ and, as journalist Yoav Sapir noted, “For the Jewish partner, being privileged meant a lot. Unlike other Jews, the privileged ones were not forced to wear the Jewish star as of 1941. And they were not included in the deportations until the end of the war.” See Yoav Sapir, ‘Mixed Marriages in Nazi Germany,’ The New York Jewish Week (23 February 2017), https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/mixed-marriages-in-nazi-germany/ (accessed 17 June 2021). About 10,000 Jews in mixed marriages survived the war. Bruskin also relates the woman’s efforts to sustain her identity with the clandestine prayer book and the Jewish cuisine. Note also the precarious nature of the timing of this “incident”: the war was not yet over and the woman continued to fear the German authorities.

With regard to his knowledge of concentration camps, Bruskin’s testimony contains certain inconsistencies: he first says he knew nothing about them, but then acknowledges that he had heard the inmates were not treated well. He seems to suggest that one didn’t “know” about a concentration camp unless one grasped the tremendous suffering there. He comments that his colleagues with G-2 (intelligence) training had a better understanding of the camps, although he implies that one cannot really comprehend them unless one was physically there. The smells and the physical condition of the inmates, for example, defy easy description. Prior to the liberation of Ebensee in early May, other camps had been liberated by the Allies, including Buchenwald on 11 April (by the Americans) and Bergen-Belsen on 15 April (by the British). Information regarding these camps was beginning to spread by the time Bruskin arrived at Ebensee.&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;aee4ae15-320c-4a9b-a4a1-a4d6d03172ca&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,1037.24],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,1062.32],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;14.

Accidents were frequently a cause of death in WWII. The combatants did not have safety gear to today’s standards and the technology failed more frequently. There were frequent airplane crashes (that took the lives of figures like Fritz Todt, Wladyslaw Sikorski, and the musician Glenn Miller). Motor vehicle accidents also took the lives of many combatants, including General George Patton. Note Bruskin’s comments about being shelled applied to his experiences in France (a dangerous phase of the war for him), but he was later also under fire in Germany. Bruskin was quite nonchalant about the shelling. It is striking that he felt more endangered in France than later in Germany. This may have had something to do with his lack of experience—he became accustomed to artillery over time—but clearly the fighting in the Normandy region in the summer of 1944 was still intense.&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;644e45a9-9b00-479a-81dc-191ada802092&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,1184.78],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,1199.8],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Jewish cemeteries were widely desecrated by Germans and their accomplices.

Located at the end of a long road heading deep into the Salzkammergut, Altaussee was a good location to stash art and for Nazis to hide out. The town was part of the Ausseerland region, which Hitler and his associates envisioned as part of the so-called Alpine Fortress. The town attracted an array of leading Nazis, including Kaltenbrunner, Adolf Eichmann, SS commando Otto Skorzeny, Viennese Gauleiter Hugo Jury, Franz Stangl (commandant of Sobibor and Treblinka) and Anton Burger (Commandant of the Theresienstadt concentration camp). Walters offered an extension of this list: “In Altaussee… among those arrested were General Erich Alt of the Luftwaffe, Walter Riedel, the construction chief of the V-2 rocket program at Peenemünde; Günther Altenburg, the German Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece; William Knothe, General Counsel of the Foreign Office; and Dr. Bailent Homan, a minister in the Hungarian puppet government installed by the Nazis.” In other words, Altaussee was an extraordinarily rich target area for Matteson, Bruskin, and their team.

From here, with the help of an RSHA staffer named Wilhelm Höttl, he became embroiled in Operation Sunrise: an effort to conclude a negotiated peace for Italy and western Austria with the Western Allies. While those negotiations bore fruit (a separate peace was concluded on 29 April), troops from the U.S. Seventh Army arrived on 8 May (the day the Soviets concluded their treaty of surrender with the German government), and Kaltenbrunner again took flight. He headed to the hills near Wildensee, just outside Altaussee, where he hid out until 12 May 1945. At the end of the war a box of 50-60 kilograms of gold and other valuables was found near the house in which Kaltenbrunner had lived. Walters adds: “Kaltenbrunner’s house in Altaussee was the Villa Kerry, which was situated on the outskirts of town and looked over the lake. Before he fled, like some villain in a potboiler, Kaltenbrunner buried his treasure in his garden. According to one estimate, he had shipped to Altaussee 50 kilograms of gold bars, fifty cases containing gold articles, two million US dollars, the same number of Swiss francs, five cases of jewels, and a stamp collection worth five million gold marks.” Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 14-15.

Heydrich died from an infection (sepsis) caused by the horsehair fibers in the seat of his car, which entered his wounds after a kind of hand-grenade exploded near him. Hitler ordered a reprisal—the execution of 10,000 randomly chosen Czechs—but subordinates counseled that this measure could hurt the productivity of the important industrial region. The Germans instead decided to enact revenge in the towns of Lidice and Lezaky: on 10 June 1942, males over the age of 16 in both towns were murdered; and all the women in Lezaky were killed. Both towns were burned to the ground. Estimates are that some 1,300 Czechs were killed in reprisal for Heydrich’s death, including at least 200 women.

He leaves out certain specifics, of course, such as that Adolf Eichmann was with Kaltenbrunner in the escape from Altaussee and before he separated from his group and hiked through the mountains heading north (he was captured later and then escaped again to South America). Bruskin also did not note that the assistant Burgermeister of Altaussee, Johann Brandauer, was the one to reveal the location of Kaltenbrunner’s hideout in the Todes Gebirg; Brandauer accompanied the detachment of ex-Wehrmacht soldiers and US troops. The mission entailed climbing over mountainous and glacial terrain for six hours in darkness before arriving at the cabin.

Regarding the capture that took place on 11/12 May 1945, Walters writes: “Matteson’s motley crew departed at midnight, their leader sporting a pair of Lederhosen, an Alpine jacket and hat, and spoked shoes. The plan was for an unarmed Matteson to pose as an innocent passerby…” See Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 16.  Matteson indeed approached the hut by himself, with his US GIs and four German guides remaining at a distance. Matteson knocked on the door, and one of Kaltenbrunner’s assitants answered it. Matteson asked to come in, but was refused. At that moment, Kaltenbrunner’s aide spotted Matteson’s support team and slammed the door. A standoff ensued, but Kaltenbrunner chose to avoid a fire-fight and surrendered. Matteson brought him back to Altaussee. See Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 15-18. So, Bruskin was there for Kaltenbrunner’s arrest. He assented to the decision to allow Kaltenbrunner to have a final meetingwith his mistress, Countess von Westarp. Bruskin and Matteson probably knew it would be difficult for her to see him after his arrest (unlike Kaltenbrunners wife, who had some rights). It is somewhat surprising that Sydney Bruskin and Robert Matteson didn’t recognize Kaltenbrunner, whose distinctive scars were famous.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;At the International Tribunal at Nuremberg, Kaltenbrunner was charged with conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. He was acquitted of the first charge, but found guilty of the latter two. He had not been present at the beginning of the proceedings after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage, but when he returned, he protested his innocence, claiming that Himmler and Gestapo leader Heinrich Müller bore responsibility for the atrocities committed during his tenure as chief of the RSHA. Kaltenbrunner also maintained he was unaware of the Holocaust, and in a contradictor manner, stated that he had protested against the treatment of the Jews to Himmler and Hitler. He went so far as to claim that he deserved credit for bringing the Final Solution to an end. On 30 September 1946, the International Military Tribunal found Kaltenbrunner not guilty of crimes against peace, but guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity (counts three and four). On 1 October 1946, the IMT sentenced him to death by hanging. Kaltenbrunner was executed 16 October 1946, and his corpse, like those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann Göring (who had committed suicide the previous day), was cremated at the Eastern Cemetery in Munich and the ashes scattered in a tributary of the Isar River.

Earl Harrison, an American representative to the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees, commented at one point, “we appear to be treating the Jews as the Nazi treated them except that we do not exterminate them.” Jennifer Orth-Veillon noted, “…not all soldiers acted equally when confronted with that responsibility, and some further mistreated them, extending the trauma they had endured while imprisoned.” See Jennifer Orth-Veillon, “For Some Holocaust Survivors, Even Liberation Was Dehumanizing,” in &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;New York Times&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (28 April 2020). &quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;06f51344-c1f5-4b77-a4c3-e49ee43ac4a1&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,2630.76],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,2667.996],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The Nazi regime undertook several programs to counterfeit British currency: the best known was at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp and known as Operation Bernhard (named after Friedrich Walter Bernhard Krueger, who oversaw the program). The Nazis used over 140 mostly Jewish skilled inmates, who received better treatment. They actually forged some 70 million notes with a value over 100 million pounds. The quality of the notes was very high and threatened the British economy, but the Germans never found a way to insert the notes into circulation: they had considered dropping them from planes, but did not pursue that option, and instead used the fake money to fund special operations. In early March 1945, the inmates in the counterfeiting unit were transferred to the concentration camp of Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria. Some of the Sachsenhausen prisoners ended up at Ebensee, which, as noted earlier, was also part of the Mauthausen-complex. The prisoners were ordered to destroy the evidence of the operation.

The liberation of the Dachau camp offers another example of retribution against German guards by both American liberating troops and camp inmates. Harald Marcuse writes, “At the slightest provocation or hint of provocation, captives and men in the process of surrendering were gunned down, perhaps forty to fifty of them… In the first hours the Americans also refrained from intervening when survivors attacked the most brutal of their former tormentors and informants.” Harald Marcuse, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Legacies of Dachau: The Uses and Abuses of a Concentration Camp, 1933-2001&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 52.&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;950fb5a3-1e2a-42fb-bb22-7e3b7ad04a66&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,2734.96],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,2755.36],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Bruskin reflects here on the challenges of communicating the horrors of the Holocaust to family and friends back home.

In his testimony, he mentions experiencing antisemitism before the war, and also in postwar America. There is the curious use of the phrase “Jew boy”: he is being self-deprecating, but the phrase also seems to grow out of his own experiences with antisemitism. His explanation of how he chose his temple is also interesting: he conveys he so wanted to develop a religious identity, to develop that part of his life, that there was a real urgency. B’nai B’rith is a Jewish service organization whose members are committed to the Jewish people and the state of Israel. Founded in 1843 in New York City by recent German-Jewish immigrants, the organization also undertakes anti-defamation efforts, educational initiatives, and provides scholarships to young people. By 1956, Bruskin was involved with organizing the 100th anniversary of the B’nai B’rith chapter in New Haven (he is listed on the program as responsible for “tablet dedication”). See https://www.bnaibrith.org/uploads/7/8/5/9/7859990/conn.pdf. Bruskin was not alone among the Jewish American soldiers whose wartime experience shaped them: see Deborah Dash Moore, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;GI Jews: How World War II Changed a Generation&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (Cambridge; Harvard University Press, 2006); and the movie &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;GI Jews: Jewish Americans in World War II&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (2018, directed by Lisa Ades), which examines the experiences of Mel Brooks, Henry Kissinger, and Carl Reiner, among others. Primo Levi recalled of the Allied liberators in The Reawakening: “They did not greet us nor did they smile. They seemed oppressed not only by compassion but by a confused restraint, which sealed their lips and bound their eyes to the funeral scene.” (Quoted in Jennifer Orth-Veillon, ‘For Some Holocaust Survivors, Even Liberation Was Dehumanizing,’ &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;New York Times&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 28 April 2020).

In 1933, he had been court martialed for selling military secrets to a foreign state and served a five-year sentence. Upon his release in 1937, he moved to Austria and by 1940 had obtained German citizenship. Baillie-Stewart had an aristocratic diction and likely inspired the name, “Lord Haw-Haw.” Because another British national, William Joyce, proved more effective, Baillie-Stewart only broadcast on German radio until December 1939, thereafter working as a translator for the German Foreign Ministry. When Baillie-Stewart was arrested by Matteson and Bruskin at Altaussee in 1945 he was wearing Lederhosen and trying to blend in with the local population. Subsequently he was sent to Britain to be tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he became known as ‘the officer in the Tower’ (he was often confused with Lord Haw-Haw). Baillie-Stewart was subsequently charged with “committing an act likely to assist the enemy” and sentenced to five years in prison. He was fortunate: William Joyce, who had been captured in Flensburg on 28 May 1945, was treated more harshly: charged with high treason, found guilty, and executed in 1946. Baillie-Stewart moved to Ireland after his release and lived under an assumed name. His biography appeared in 1967, a year after his death.

At the war’s end, he ordered bombs to be placed in the entrance to the Altaussee salt mine, where thousands of artistic masterpieces, including the Ghent altarpiece, were stored. Eigruber issued an order that the treasures must not fall into enemy hands—an order that was thankfully subverted (with the help of Austrian miners). Eigruber himself fled Linz using forged papers, and he too was in the Salzkammergut at the time Kaltenbrunner was hiding out there.

Sidney had married Shirley Levine (1917-1990) and they had a daughter, Phyllis, in 1943. U.S. draft policies in World War II were such that, with a wife and child, Sidney was not immediately drafted. The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, also known as the Burke–Wadsworth Act, enacted September 16, 1940, “was the first peacetime conscription in United States history. This Selective Service Act required that men who had reached their 21st birthday but had not yet reached their 36th birthday register with local draft boards. Later, when the U.S. entered World War II, all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 45th birthday were made subject to military service, and all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 65th birthday were required to register.… By the early summer of 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked the U.S. Congress to extend the term of duty for the draftees beyond twelve months to a total of thirty months, plus any additional time that he could deem necessary for national security…. After the United States entered World War II, amendments to the Selective Training and Service Act on December 20, 1941, made all men between the ages of 20 and 44 liable for military service, and required all men between the ages of 18 and 64 to register.… From October 1940 until March 1947, when the wartime Selective Training and Service Act expired after extensions by Congress, over 10,000,000 men were inducted.” More broadly, the U.S. federal government has turned to the draft six times in history (American Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts). Conscription came to an end only in 1973 when the United States Armed Forces became all-voluntary. See “Selective Training and the Selective Service Act of 1940, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Training_and_Service_Act_of_1940 (accessed 21 March 2022). From October 1940 until March 1947“49 million men had been registered, 36 million classified, and 10 million inducted.” See “Conscription in the United States” at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States (accessed 21 March 2022).&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;set&quot;:[0,&quot;c4e79b95-4868-433e-a362-4c5d87fe84a8&quot;],&quot;setName&quot;:[0,&quot;Jonathan Petropoulos Critical Edition [Transcript]&quot;],&quot;file&quot;:[0,&quot;94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;8a001267-f51f-4caa-a45d-53301cdb05bc&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,156.808],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,189.19],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\tUm, I-- I got my, uh, letter from the president in September of 1943.

A brief word on the facilities mentioned by Bruskin: “Armory Court,” one observer noted, “is a building of power. Located at the north end of Orange Street, right before East Rock Park, this ‘medieval castle’ stands out imposingly from the residential surroundings. Its hexagonal towers and battlements have an instantly recognizable silhouette, an homage to Romanesque architecture that creates a sense of security for the condominium complex that lies behind the large iron gate. While the owners of Armory Court have changed through the last century, the building has retained its present form for more than a hundred years. Built in 1906, it was used as a barracks and stable for the Troop A Cavalry, a part of the Connecticut National Guard. It remained in use by the military until 1970, when it was acquired by the former South Central Community College, which used the building’s powerful image to house their administration office building. After renovations in 1987, Armory Court assumed its present function - a condominium complex divided into small, single-family rowhouse apartments.” See (https://nhba.yale.edu/building?id=5e596a2ab5abb055a040dfc0 (accessed 21 March 2022) more detailed account of the Armory, with its rich material history, adds: “When the armory closed around 2009, and the City of New Haven gained possession, veterans from the 102nd Regiment removed a portrait of Sargent Stubby, the 102nd regiment’s famous war dog, as well as the furnishings and restaged the room for exhibit in the West Haven Veteran’s Museum and Learning Center circa 2010. 7 WPA murals feature the Foot Guards’ most famous lore: Benedict Arnold’s famous march to the New Haven Green to demand the keys to the powder house on the eve of the Revolution. Around 2010, original light fixtures and wood paneling were removed to Yale University, the West Haven Veterans Museum, and the new Foot Guard headquarters at the armory in Branford, Connecticut…. From the end of its construction in 1930 through 2009, the armory has served as a center for military preparations and disaster relief, and as a clubhouse for those serving. The building is also significant at the state level in the category of Social History as a host for large community, state, and regional celebrations and events over several decades. This includes New Haven’s African American activist community, who in the 1970s, continued to work for social and economic justice in the later years of the Civil Rights Movement.” See https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DECD/Historic-Preservation/06_About_SHPO/State-Review-Board/Dec-4-2020/New-Haven-Armory-NR.pdf&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;set&quot;:[0,&quot;c4e79b95-4868-433e-a362-4c5d87fe84a8&quot;],&quot;setName&quot;:[0,&quot;Jonathan Petropoulos Critical Edition [Transcript]&quot;],&quot;file&quot;:[0,&quot;94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;e10bc37f-b509-48b9-a1a5-f12f078de085&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,189.19],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,210.58],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\tAnd so for, of course, I-- I remember I was very sad, because my daughter was just a few months old.

As the Allies prepared an invasion of the Continent, hundreds of thousands of American soldiers were stationed in Great Britain. This sometimes resulted in friction, with the phrase ‘over-paid, over-sexed, and over-here’ becoming commonplace. In Bruskin’s case, the new father evidently was not interested in British women, but in making some money. His account relates how he sought to transact business, indeed, to ply his trade, while stationed abroad. While Bruskin’s wife had taken over his bike business back in New Haven, he still hoped to contribute to the family income while in the service. That he found time to entertain purchases indicates the relatively relaxed atmosphere prior to D-Day and the actual fighting against the Germans.

Omaha Beach proved the most contested and difficult of the five landing beaches for D-Day on 6 June 1944, with between 4,000 and 9,000 Allied casualties. The beach is about six miles wide and as the Allies landed some 34,000 troops that day (most delivered away from the planned locations), they came under heavy fire from the Germans and their allies. They eventually prevailed in the days that followed. The Allies removed the obstacles to amphibious landings, including taking out 250 massive steel “Belgian Gate” barricades and 11,000 beams used as anti-tank and anti-landing craft defenses. By the time Bruskin arrived at D-plus-30, Omaha Beach had become a transit center that facilitated the liberation of Normandy and then all of France.

For the history of the 80th Division, see the website regarding the 80 th Infantry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80th_Division_(United_States). On 5 August 1944, the 80th Infantry landed at Utah Beach and then fought its way across France until they ran out of gas at the river Seille. They later fought at the Battle of the Bulge, where they helped rescue the 101 st Airborne Division under siege in Bastogne. The 80 th Division crossed the Rhine on 27–28 March, near Mainz and subsequently fought in Kassel, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Nuremberg, among other locations. The U.S. Army’s 80th infantry division had a storied history during WWII as part of General George Patton’s Third Army and the division featured a notable branch of the Counterintelligence Corps, or CIC. The CIC had evolved from the Military Intelligence Service’s Counter Intelligence Branch. Utilizing information provided by the Office of Strategic Services, or OSS, which was another branch of the War Department and a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIC was tasked with “locating criminals, Nazi records, and looted property.” Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Plunder and Restitution&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2000), SR-218. Journalist Guy Walters notes of the CIC, “Originally established in August 1917 as the Corps of Intelligence Police, the fifty-strong unit ran counter-espionage operations in northern France toward the end of the First World War. Between the wars it underwent various mutations, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor it was renamed the CIC and authorized to recruit 1,026 non-commissioned officers. This was rapidly swelled to 4,431, with a provision for 543 officers. The men selected for the CIC were often expected to have some form of legal experience, although as the war went on this requirement was waived, and recruits were merely expected to have an adequate education, be of ‘good character,’ and loyal to the flag…. The CIC was not a haven for shirkers, however. Six of its units came ashore in Normandy on D-Day and counter-espionage work is not without its dangers.” Guy Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil: The Nazi War Criminals Who Escaped and the Quest to Bring Them to Justice&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (New York: Broadway Books, 2009), 63. Walters adds, “After the invasion [of Normandy] the principal role of the CIC detachments was to screen displaced persons, and to determine whether they were enemy agents or war criminals masquerading as civilians. By the time the Allies had entered Germany, the CIC’s role was to arrest Nazis and other Germans who represented a threat to the Allied forces. In addition to ‘normal’ counter-espionage work, the CIC had to secure Nazi party buildings in order to safeguard the documents they contained…. The British may have been envious of the resources the American Nazi-hunting units had at their disposal, but they were a little sniffy about their methods. ‘They were very gung-ho,’ recalled John Hodge, a captain in the British War Crimes Team; ‘they all had pistols and went ‘come on, let’s go get him!’” Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 63. Despite the enthusiasm of CIC personnel, they suffered from a shortage of translators. As one history of the organization notes, “The greatest single CIC procurement problem during the war was the difficulty in obtaining linguists who were qualified for CIC duty... As reports poured in to the Office of the Chief from tactical units throughout the world, all stressed the need for agents who could conduct interrogations in the native languages of the countries in which they were serving.” George Chalou, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Covert Warfare: The Counter Intelligence Corps in Action&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (New York: Garland, 1989), chapter 7 (no page numbers provided).

Bruskin here speaks to the survival of German Jews, either due to being in a ‘mixed-marriage’ or as ‘U-boats.’ Even though the Nazis had made such marriages illegal as part of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, the law did not annul existing marriages. In 1933, there were about 35,000 mixed marriages in Germany and by 1939 there were about 20,000 (with the number dropping to 12,000 by the end of 1944). The decline was partly due to demographics, partly to Nazi authorities putting pressure on Christians to divorce Jewish spouses, and partly due to the genocide that occurred later in the war. For most of the Third Reich, the Jewish partners in a mixed marriage were considered ‘privileged,’ and, as journalist Yoav Sapir noted, “For the Jewish partner, being privileged meant a lot. Unlike other Jews, the privileged ones were not forced to wear the Jewish star as of 1941. And they were not included in the deportations until the end of the war.” See Yoav Sapir, ‘Mixed Marriages in Nazi Germany,’ The New York Jewish Week (23 February 2017), https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/mixed-marriages-in-nazi-germany/ (accessed 17 June 2021). About 10,000 Jews in mixed marriages survived the war. Bruskin also relates the woman’s efforts to sustain her identity with the clandestine prayer book and the Jewish cuisine.

With regard to his knowledge of concentration camps, Bruskin’s testimony contains certain inconsistencies: he first says he knew nothing about them, but then acknowledges that he had heard the inmates were not treated well. He seems to suggest that one didn’t “know” about a concentration camp unless one grasped the tremendous suffering there. He comments that his colleagues with G-2 (intelligence) training had a better understanding of the camps, although he implies that one cannot really comprehend them unless one was physically there. The smells and the physical condition of the inmates, for example, defy easy description. Prior to the liberation of Ebensee in early May, other camps had been liberated by the Allies, including Buchenwald on 11 April (by the Americans) and Bergen-Belsen on 15 April (by the British).

There were frequent airplane crashes (that took the lives of figures like Fritz Todt, Wladyslaw Sikorski, and the musician Glenn Miller). Motor vehicle accidents also took the lives of many combatants, including General George Patton. Note Bruskin’s comments about being shelled applied to his experiences in France (a dangerous phase of the war for him), but he was later also under fire in Germany. Bruskin was quite nonchalant about the shelling. It is striking that he felt more endangered in France than later in Germany. This may have had something to do with his lack of experience—he became accustomed to artillery over time—but clearly the fighting in the Normandy region in the summer of 1944 was still intense.&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;set&quot;:[0,&quot;c4e79b95-4868-433e-a362-4c5d87fe84a8&quot;],&quot;setName&quot;:[0,&quot;Jonathan Petropoulos Critical Edition [Transcript]&quot;],&quot;file&quot;:[0,&quot;94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;45580c60-2f5f-46e6-b9a3-33a1c8612e80&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,1133.12],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,1152.17],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\tWell, I-- I said to myself, oh my god, what an awful place to die.

The best study on him remains Peter Black&#39;s biography from 1984, which portrays Kaltenbrunner as a radical Nazi and chronicles the Austrian&#39;s rise to the top of the SS security apparatus. Black discusses Kaltenbrunner’s last days, after he left his political headquarters in Salzburg to head to Altaussee, which attracted many high-ranking Nazis at the war&#39;s end (see below), including Kaltenbrunner&#39;s childhood friend, Adolf Eichmann, who also took refuge in the mountains surrounding the town. On Kaltenbrunner’s trial before the IMT, Black notes: \&quot;Most remarkable in Kaltenbrunner’s prison writings is the absence of any guilt, remorse, or even reflection on the millions of innocent people who had been murdered by the regime that he served or who had died as a result of its policies.

Located at the end of a long road heading deep into the Salzkammergut, Altaussee was a good location to stash art and for Nazis to hide out. The town was part of the Ausseerland region, which Hitler and his associates envisioned as part of the so-called Alpine Fortress. The town attracted an array of leading Nazis, including Kaltenbrunner, Adolf Eichmann, SS commando Otto Skorzeny, Viennese Gauleiter Hugo Jury, Franz Stangl (commandant of Sobibor and Treblinka) and Anton Burger (Commandant of the Theresienstadt concentration camp). Walters offered an extension of this list: “In Altaussee… among those arrested were General Erich Alt of the Luftwaffe, Walter Riedel, the construction chief of the V-2 rocket program at Peenemünde; Günther Altenburg, the German Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece; William Knothe, General Counsel of the Foreign Office; and Dr. Bailent Homan, a minister in the Hungarian puppet government installed by the Nazis.” In other words, Altaussee was an extraordinarily rich target area for Matteson, Bruskin, and their team.

From here, with the help of an RSHA staffer named Wilhelm Höttl, he became embroiled in Operation Sunrise: an effort to conclude a negotiated peace for Italy and western Austria with the Western Allies. While those negotiations bore fruit (a separate peace was concluded on 29 April), troops from the U.S. Seventh Army arrived on 8 May (the day the Soviets concluded their treaty of surrender with the German government), and Kaltenbrunner again took flight. He headed to the hills near Wildensee, just outside Altaussee, where he hid out until 12 May 1945. At the end of the war a box of 50-60 kilograms of gold and other valuables was found near the house in which Kaltenbrunner had lived. Walters adds: “Kaltenbrunner’s house in Altaussee was the Villa Kerry, which was situated on the outskirts of town and looked over the lake. Before he fled, like some villain in a potboiler, Kaltenbrunner buried his treasure in his garden. According to one estimate, he had shipped to Altaussee 50 kilograms of gold bars, fifty cases containing gold articles, two million US dollars, the same number of Swiss francs, five cases of jewels, and a stamp collection worth five million gold marks.” Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 14-15.

Heydrich died from an infection (sepsis) caused by the horsehair fibers in the seat of his car, which entered his wounds after a kind of hand-grenade exploded near him. Hitler ordered a reprisal—the execution of 10,000 randomly chosen Czechs—but subordinates counseled that this measure could hurt the productivity of the important industrial region. The Germans instead decided to enact revenge in the towns of Lidice and Lezaky: on 10 June 1942, males over the age of 16 in both towns were murdered; and all the women in Lezaky were killed. Both towns were burned to the ground. Estimates are that some 1,300 Czechs were killed in reprisal for Heydrich’s death, including at least 200 women.

He leaves out certain specifics, of course, such as that Adolf Eichmann was with Kaltenbrunner in the escape from Altaussee and before he separated from his group and hiked through the mountains heading north (he was captured later and then escaped again to South America). Bruskin also did not note that the assistant Burgermeister of Altaussee, Johann Brandauer, was the one to reveal the location of Kaltenbrunner’s hideout in the Todes Gebirg; Brandauer accompanied the detachment of ex-Wehrmacht soldiers and US troops. The mission entailed climbing over mountainous and glacial terrain for six hours in darkness before arriving at the cabin.

Walters tells a similar story, referring to Matteson as “a political–science teacher and a Harvard MA,” with “his interpreter Sydney Bruskin.” See Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 15. Regarding the capture that took place on 11/12 May 1945, Walters writes: “Matteson’s motley crew departed at midnight, their leader sporting a pair of Lederhosen, an Alpine jacket and hat, and spoked shoes. The plan was for an unarmed Matteson to pose as an innocent passerby…” See Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 16.  Matteson indeed approached the hut by himself, with his US GIs and four German guides remaining at a distance. Matteson knocked on the door, and one of Kaltenbrunner’s assitants answered it. Matteson asked to come in, but was refused. At that moment, Kaltenbrunner’s aide spotted Matteson’s support team and slammed the door. A standoff ensued, but Kaltenbrunner chose to avoid a fire-fight and surrendered. Matteson brought him back to Altaussee. See Walters, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Hunting Evil&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;, 15-18. So, Bruskin was there for Kaltenbrunner’s arrest. He assented to the decision to allow Kaltenbrunner to have a final meetingwith his mistress, Countess von Westarp. Bruskin and Matteson probably knew it would be difficult for her to see him after his arrest (unlike Kaltenbrunners wife, who had some rights). It is somewhat surprising that Sydney Bruskin and Robert Matteson didn’t recognize Kaltenbrunner, whose distinctive scars were famous.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;At the International Tribunal at Nuremberg, Kaltenbrunner was charged with conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. He was acquitted of the first charge, but found guilty of the latter two. He had not been present at the beginning of the proceedings after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage, but when he returned, he protested his innocence, claiming that Himmler and Gestapo leader Heinrich Müller bore responsibility for the atrocities committed during his tenure as chief of the RSHA. Kaltenbrunner also maintained he was unaware of the Holocaust, and in a contradictor manner, stated that he had protested against the treatment of the Jews to Himmler and Hitler. He went so far as to claim that he deserved credit for bringing the Final Solution to an end. On 30 September 1946, the International Military Tribunal found Kaltenbrunner not guilty of crimes against peace, but guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity (counts three and four). On 1 October 1946, the IMT sentenced him to death by hanging. Kaltenbrunner was executed 16 October 1946, and his corpse, like those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann Göring (who had committed suicide the previous day), was cremated at the Eastern Cemetery in Munich and the ashes scattered in a tributary of the Isar River.

For top Austrian Nazis like Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Adolf Eichmann, and the others previously mentioned as present in Altaussee, among others, they hoped that their knowledge of this region of the Alps would enable them to escape from the enemy. In certain case, this occurred, as with Austrian SS officer Adolf Wächter, who took refuge in the Alps and benefitted from the Vatican (and U.S.) aided ‘Ratline.’ Author Philippe Sands noted in his riveting account of Wächter that the Americans never climbed above 10,000 feet, a tendency known by Wächter and his wife Charlotte, who helped supply him during his flight.

Initially, the Allies frequently overfed the liberated prisoners, whose systems were not prepared for the kind of solid food provided. This became known as ‘refeeding syndrome.’ The Allies soon learned to gradually increase the portions, and this worked in many cases, although, of course, many perished after liberation. The treatment of liberated inmates was by no means uniform, with some experiencing discrimination, mistreatment, and terrible conditions. Earl Harrison, an American representative to the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees, commented at one point, “we appear to be treating the Jews as the Nazi treated them except that we do not exterminate them.” Jennifer Orth-Veillon noted, “…not all soldiers acted equally when confronted with that responsibility, and some further mistreated them, extending the trauma they had endured while imprisoned.” See Jennifer Orth-Veillon, “For Some Holocaust Survivors, Even Liberation Was Dehumanizing,” in &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;New York Times&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (28 April 2020). &quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;set&quot;:[0,&quot;c4e79b95-4868-433e-a362-4c5d87fe84a8&quot;],&quot;setName&quot;:[0,&quot;Jonathan Petropoulos Critical Edition [Transcript]&quot;],&quot;file&quot;:[0,&quot;94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;78de6ea1-dc2f-421f-b34e-efc45cf866bc&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,2630.76],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,2667.996],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\tWell, we learned other things later, for instance, that there-- there was a big, eh, eh, counterfeiting group there.

The Nazis used over 140 mostly Jewish skilled inmates, who received better treatment. They actually forged some 70 million notes with a value over 100 million pounds. The quality of the notes was very high and threatened the British economy, but the Germans never found a way to insert the notes into circulation: they had considered dropping them from planes, but did not pursue that option, and instead used the fake money to fund special operations. In early March 1945, the inmates in the counterfeiting unit were transferred to the concentration camp of Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria. Some of the Sachsenhausen prisoners ended up at Ebensee, which, as noted earlier, was also part of the Mauthausen-complex. The prisoners were ordered to destroy the evidence of the operation.

In 1933, he had been court martialed for selling military secrets to a foreign state and served a five-year sentence. Upon his release in 1937, he moved to Austria and by 1940 had obtained German citizenship. Baillie-Stewart had an aristocratic diction and likely inspired the name, “Lord Haw-Haw.” Because another British national, William Joyce, proved more effective, Baillie-Stewart only broadcast on German radio until December 1939, thereafter working as a translator for the German Foreign Ministry. When Baillie-Stewart was arrested by Matteson and Bruskin at Altaussee in 1945 he was wearing Lederhosen and trying to blend in with the local population. Subsequently he was sent to Britain to be tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he became known as ‘the officer in the Tower’ (he was often confused with Lord Haw-Haw). Baillie-Stewart was subsequently charged with “committing an act likely to assist the enemy” and sentenced to five years in prison. He was fortunate: William Joyce, who had been captured in Flensburg on 28 May 1945, was treated more harshly: charged with high treason, found guilty, and executed in 1946. Baillie-Stewart moved to Ireland after his release and lived under an assumed name. His biography appeared in 1967, a year after his death.

Eigruber counted among the most radical Nazi leaders (he had joined the Nazi Party in 1928, especially early for an Austrian). At the war’s end, he ordered bombs to be placed in the entrance to the Altaussee salt mine, where thousands of artistic masterpieces, including the Ghent altarpiece, were stored. Eigruber issued an order that the treasures must not fall into enemy hands—an order that was thankfully subverted (with the help of Austrian miners). Eigruber himself fled Linz using forged papers, and he too was in the Salzkammergut at the time Kaltenbrunner was hiding out there. Matteson and Bruskin had intelligence that they were close behind Eigruber, but at the same time, they received the tip on Kaltenbrunner, and followed up that lead.

Sidney had married Shirley Levine (1917-1990) and they had a daughter, Phyllis, in 1943. U.S. draft policies in World War II were such that, with a wife and child, Sidney was not immediately drafted. The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, also known as the Burke–Wadsworth Act, enacted September 16, 1940, “was the first peacetime conscription in United States history. This Selective Service Act required that men who had reached their 21st birthday but had not yet reached their 36th birthday register with local draft boards. Later, when the U.S. entered World War II, all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 45th birthday were made subject to military service, and all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 65th birthday were required to register.… By the early summer of 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked the U.S. Congress to extend the term of duty for the draftees beyond twelve months to a total of thirty months, plus any additional time that he could deem necessary for national security…. After the United States entered World War II, amendments to the Selective Training and Service Act on December 20, 1941, made all men between the ages of 20 and 44 liable for military service, and required all men between the ages of 18 and 64 to register.… From October 1940 until March 1947, when the wartime Selective Training and Service Act expired after extensions by Congress, over 10,000,000 men were inducted.” More broadly, the U.S. federal government has turned to the draft six times in history (American Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts). Conscription came to an end only in 1973 when the United States Armed Forces became all-voluntary. See “Selective Training and the Selective Service Act of 1940, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Training_and_Service_Act_of_1940 (accessed 21 March 2022). From October 1940 until March 1947“49 million men had been registered, 36 million classified, and 10 million inducted.” See “Conscription in the United States” at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States (accessed 21 March 2022).</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r510" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="156.808" data-end="189.19" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="8a001267-f51f-4caa-a45d-53301cdb05bc"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="156.808" data-end="189.19" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 02:36&nbsp;- 03:09 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	Um, I-- I got my, uh, letter from the president in September of 1943.

A brief word on the facilities mentioned by Bruskin: “Armory Court,” one observer noted, “is a building of power. Located at the north end of Orange Street, right before East Rock Park, this ‘medieval castle’ stands out imposingly from the residential surroundings. Its hexagonal towers and battlements have an instantly recognizable silhouette, an homage to Romanesque architecture that creates a sense of security for the condominium complex that lies behind the large iron gate. While the owners of Armory Court have changed through the last century, the building has retained its present form for more than a hundred years. Built in 1906, it was used as a barracks and stable for the Troop A Cavalry, a part of the Connecticut National Guard. It remained in use by the military until 1970, when it was acquired by the former South Central Community College, which used the building’s powerful image to house their administration office building. After renovations in 1987, Armory Court assumed its present function - a condominium complex divided into small, single-family rowhouse apartments.” See (https://nhba.yale.edu/building?id=5e596a2ab5abb055a040dfc0 (accessed 21 March 2022) more detailed account of the Armory, with its rich material history, adds: “When the armory closed around 2009, and the City of New Haven gained possession, veterans from the 102nd Regiment removed a portrait of Sargent Stubby, the 102nd regiment’s famous war dog, as well as the furnishings and restaged the room for exhibit in the West Haven Veteran’s Museum and Learning Center circa 2010. 7 WPA murals feature the Foot Guards’ most famous lore: Benedict Arnold’s famous march to the New Haven Green to demand the keys to the powder house on the eve of the Revolution. Around 2010, original light fixtures and wood paneling were removed to Yale University, the West Haven Veterans Museum, and the new Foot Guard headquarters at the armory in Branford, Connecticut…. From the end of its construction in 1930 through 2009, the armory has served as a center for military preparations and disaster relief, and as a clubhouse for those serving. The building is also significant at the state level in the category of Social History as a host for large community, state, and regional celebrations and events over several decades. This includes New Haven’s African American activist community, who in the 1970s, continued to work for social and economic justice in the later years of the Civil Rights Movement.” See https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DECD/Historic-Preservation/06_About_SHPO/State-Review-Board/Dec-4-2020/New-Haven-Armory-NR.pdf</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r512" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="189.19" data-end="210.58" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="e10bc37f-b509-48b9-a1a5-f12f078de085"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="189.19" data-end="210.58" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 03:09&nbsp;- 03:30 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	And so for, of course, I-- I remember I was very sad, because my daughter was just a few months old.

As the Allies prepared an invasion of the Continent, hundreds of thousands of American soldiers were stationed in Great Britain. This sometimes resulted in friction, with the phrase ‘over-paid, over-sexed, and over-here’ becoming commonplace. In Bruskin’s case, the new father evidently was not interested in British women, but in making some money. His account relates how he sought to transact business, indeed, to ply his trade, while stationed abroad. While Bruskin’s wife had taken over his bike business back in New Haven, he still hoped to contribute to the family income while in the service. That he found time to entertain purchases indicates the relatively relaxed atmosphere prior to D-Day and the actual fighting against the Germans.

Omaha Beach proved the most contested and difficult of the five landing beaches for D-Day on 6 June 1944, with between 4,000 and 9,000 Allied casualties. The beach is about six miles wide and as the Allies landed some 34,000 troops that day (most delivered away from the planned locations), they came under heavy fire from the Germans and their allies. They eventually prevailed in the days that followed. The Allies removed the obstacles to amphibious landings, including taking out 250 massive steel “Belgian Gate” barricades and 11,000 beams used as anti-tank and anti-landing craft defenses. By the time Bruskin arrived at D-plus-30, Omaha Beach had become a transit center that facilitated the liberation of Normandy and then all of France. Infrastructure and logistics would prove crucial to the Allied victory.

For the history of the 80th Division, see the website regarding the 80 th Infantry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80th_Division_(United_States). On 5 August 1944, the 80th Infantry landed at Utah Beach and then fought its way across France until they ran out of gas at the river Seille. They later fought at the Battle of the Bulge, where they helped rescue the 101 st Airborne Division under siege in Bastogne. The 80 th Division crossed the Rhine on 27–28 March, near Mainz and subsequently fought in Kassel, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Nuremberg, among other locations. The U.S. Army’s 80th infantry division had a storied history during WWII as part of General George Patton’s Third Army and the division featured a notable branch of the Counterintelligence Corps, or CIC. The CIC had evolved from the Military Intelligence Service’s Counter Intelligence Branch. Utilizing information provided by the Office of Strategic Services, or OSS, which was another branch of the War Department and a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIC was tasked with “locating criminals, Nazi records, and looted property.” Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, <em>Plunder and Restitution</em> (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2000), SR-218. Journalist Guy Walters notes of the CIC, “Originally established in August 1917 as the Corps of Intelligence Police, the fifty-strong unit ran counter-espionage operations in northern France toward the end of the First World War. Between the wars it underwent various mutations, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor it was renamed the CIC and authorized to recruit 1,026 non-commissioned officers. This was rapidly swelled to 4,431, with a provision for 543 officers. The men selected for the CIC were often expected to have some form of legal experience, although as the war went on this requirement was waived, and recruits were merely expected to have an adequate education, be of ‘good character,’ and loyal to the flag…. The CIC was not a haven for shirkers, however. Six of its units came ashore in Normandy on D-Day and counter-espionage work is not without its dangers.” Guy Walters, <em>Hunting Evil: The Nazi War Criminals Who Escaped and the Quest to Bring Them to Justice</em> (New York: Broadway Books, 2009), 63. Walters adds, “After the invasion [of Normandy] the principal role of the CIC detachments was to screen displaced persons, and to determine whether they were enemy agents or war criminals masquerading as civilians. By the time the Allies had entered Germany, the CIC’s role was to arrest Nazis and other Germans who represented a threat to the Allied forces. In addition to ‘normal’ counter-espionage work, the CIC had to secure Nazi party buildings in order to safeguard the documents they contained…. The British may have been envious of the resources the American Nazi-hunting units had at their disposal, but they were a little sniffy about their methods. ‘They were very gung-ho,’ recalled John Hodge, a captain in the British War Crimes Team; ‘they all had pistols and went ‘come on, let’s go get him!’” Walters, <em>Hunting Evil</em>, 63. Despite the enthusiasm of CIC personnel, they suffered from a shortage of translators. As one history of the organization notes, “The greatest single CIC procurement problem during the war was the difficulty in obtaining linguists who were qualified for CIC duty... As reports poured in to the Office of the Chief from tactical units throughout the world, all stressed the need for agents who could conduct interrogations in the native languages of the countries in which they were serving.” George Chalou, <em>Covert Warfare: The Counter Intelligence Corps in Action</em> (New York: Garland, 1989), chapter 7 (no page numbers provided). Bruskin, the former French major at Yale, therefore found a position in the CIC and became a Nazi hunter.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r528" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="479.41" data-end="520.84" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="2183ce93-7dbc-4254-9480-96f47ff03c37"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="479.41" data-end="520.84" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 07:59&nbsp;- 08:40 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	And, uh, that was in France.

The search for French Nazis and youths who had fought in the Wehrmacht could turn brutal. Scholars talk of ‘savage’ justice as the war ended, which at times involved immediate execution of those believed guilty, as well as more bureaucratic justice for those who collaborated (épuration sauvage and épuration legale). This was a French-led effort, but, as Bruskin noted, the Allies also pursued certain Vichy officials. See Herbert Lottman, <em>The People’s Anger: Justice and Revenge in Post-Liberation France</em> (London: Hutchinson, 1986); Marc Bergère, <em>L’épuration en France</em> (Paris: Que sais-je? 2018); Fracois Broche, <em>Histoire de la Collaboration: 1940-1945 </em>(Paris: Tallandier, 2017); and Keith Lowe, <em>Savage Continent: Europe in the Aftermath of World War II</em> (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2012).

John T. Vance Jr. was a 1st Lieutenant, A. C., Station Weather Office, and one of his reports about weather conditions in the spring of 1945 is included in an important history of the CIC. His brother, Cyrus Vance (1917-2002), served as U.S. Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter; during WWII, Cyrus served in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, and then went on to a career on Wall Street and then in public service. Americans in Europe enjoyed the availability of alcohol as compared to the USA (even post-Prohibition). The politics of wine has been studied in several books: how the Germans attempted to seize the finest bottles, the French efforts to thwart them, and the Allies’ custom of “liberating” supplies. See, for example, Donald Kladstrup and Petie Kladstrup, <em>Wine and War: The French, the Nazis, and the Battle for France’s Greatest Treasure</em> (New York: Broadway Books, 2001); and Christophe Lucand, <em>Hitler’s Vineyards: How the French Winemakers Collaborated with the Nazis</em> (Barnsley: Pen &amp; Sword Military, 2019). This story is also notable in terms of the use of objects as a kind of talisman by troops (superstition arises in response to the danger and trauma of war).

Bruskin here speaks to the survival of German Jews, either due to being in a ‘mixed-marriage’ or as ‘U-boats.’ Even though the Nazis had made such marriages illegal as part of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, the law did not annul existing marriages. In 1933, there were about 35,000 mixed marriages in Germany and by 1939 there were about 20,000 (with the number dropping to 12,000 by the end of 1944). The decline was partly due to demographics, partly to Nazi authorities putting pressure on Christians to divorce Jewish spouses, and partly due to the genocide that occurred later in the war. For most of the Third Reich, the Jewish partners in a mixed marriage were considered ‘privileged,’ and, as journalist Yoav Sapir noted, “For the Jewish partner, being privileged meant a lot. Unlike other Jews, the privileged ones were not forced to wear the Jewish star as of 1941. And they were not included in the deportations until the end of the war.” See Yoav Sapir, ‘Mixed Marriages in Nazi Germany,’ The New York Jewish Week (23 February 2017), https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/mixed-marriages-in-nazi-germany/ (accessed 17 June 2021). About 10,000 Jews in mixed marriages survived the war. Bruskin also relates the woman’s efforts to sustain her identity with the clandestine prayer book and the Jewish cuisine. Note also the precarious nature of the timing of this “incident”: the war was not yet over and the woman continued to fear the German authorities.

With regard to his knowledge of concentration camps, Bruskin’s testimony contains certain inconsistencies: he first says he knew nothing about them, but then acknowledges that he had heard the inmates were not treated well. He seems to suggest that one didn’t “know” about a concentration camp unless one grasped the tremendous suffering there. He comments that his colleagues with G-2 (intelligence) training had a better understanding of the camps, although he implies that one cannot really comprehend them unless one was physically there. The smells and the physical condition of the inmates, for example, defy easy description. Prior to the liberation of Ebensee in early May, other camps had been liberated by the Allies, including Buchenwald on 11 April (by the Americans) and Bergen-Belsen on 15 April (by the British). Information regarding these camps was beginning to spread by the time Bruskin arrived at Ebensee.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r568" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="1009.7" data-end="1037.24" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="75d988a6-0d67-44b5-8110-51b466710358"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="1009.7" data-end="1037.24" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 16:49&nbsp;- 17:17 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	Well, uh, we decided that we had to put a stop to this.

Sydney Bruskin did not kill anyone during the war, but he used his gun here (at least as a threat). In his account, he appeared prepared to commit violence (but note that he says “shoot up the place,” not shoot the official from the telephone company).

The manager of the telephone company lies (saying he cannot do it) and then requests that his actions be concealed.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r571" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="1062.32" data-end="1076.585" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="e92141ce-3bb9-417a-9af7-960800904a6a"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="1062.32" data-end="1076.585" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 17:42&nbsp;- 17:56 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	Well, it--it so happens that there was a-- a-- a member of the Associated Press traveling with our outfit, and he heard about it.

Accidents were frequently a cause of death in WWII. The combatants did not have safety gear to today’s standards and the technology failed more frequently. There were frequent airplane crashes (that took the lives of figures like Fritz Todt, Wladyslaw Sikorski, and the musician Glenn Miller). Motor vehicle accidents also took the lives of many combatants, including General George Patton. Note Bruskin’s comments about being shelled applied to his experiences in France (a dangerous phase of the war for him), but he was later also under fire in Germany. Bruskin was quite nonchalant about the shelling. It is striking that he felt more endangered in France than later in Germany. This may have had something to do with his lack of experience—he became accustomed to artillery over time—but clearly the fighting in the Normandy region in the summer of 1944 was still intense.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r578" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="1133.12" data-end="1152.17" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="45580c60-2f5f-46e6-b9a3-33a1c8612e80"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="1133.12" data-end="1152.17" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 18:53&nbsp;- 19:12 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	Well, I-- I said to myself, oh my god, what an awful place to die.

There is a long history of damaging Jewish cemeteries, and many Nazis were cognizant of this history. Attacking burial sites was part of a broader assault on Jewish life. The use of headstones to pave roads offered a vivid act of cultural vandalism (Steven Spielberg included it in Schindler’s List in the scene set at the Plaszów camp). A scholarly literature on Jewish cemeteries (including their postwar restoration) has developed. See Adolf Diamant, Geschändete jüdische Friedhöfe in Deutschland, 1945-1999 (Potsdam: Verlag für Berlin-Brandenburg, 2000); Monika Schmidt, Schändungen jüdischer Friedhöfe in der DDR: eine Dokumentation (Berlin: Metropol, 2007); Joachim Jacobs, Houses of Life: Jewish Cemeteries of Europe (London: Frances Lincoln, 2008); and Rudolf Klein, Metropolitan Jewish Cemeteries of the 19th and 20th Centuries in Central and Eastern Europe: A Comparative Study (Petersberg: Michael Imhof Verlag, 2018). See also the reflections of Benjamin Ferencz, who helped administer Jewish cemeteries after the war: &#39;Reclaiming Cemeteries,&#39; at  <a class="text-blue-link" href="https://benferencz.org/stories/1948-1956/reclaiming-cemeteries/">https://benferencz.org/stories/1948-1956/reclaiming-cemeteries/</a>  (accessed 10 October 2021).

But the Palace of Justice survived largely intact (a primary reason the International Military Tribunal was held there—it was one of the few structures that existed that could accommodate the defendants, the witnesses, and the guards and prosecution). Bruskin took photos of the Nuremberg tribune, which, like &#39;souvenirs&#39; helped combatants feel connected to the history they were experiencing. The Nuremberg tribune, which was located on the outskirts of the city, had survived the Allies&#39; bombing raids. The Americans, however, used a Howitzer to blow the Reich Eagle and swastika sculpture off the top of the Tribune, but the rest of the structure has survived (and is used for concerts today). It was designed by Albert Speer and there is a permanent exhibition in the structure (titled <em>Faszination und Gewalt</em>, &#39;fascination and violence&#39;).</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r596" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="1364.666" data-end="1367.735" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="140ebfb5-17fd-4d83-b100-0079510aa1a8"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="1364.666" data-end="1367.735" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 22:44&nbsp;- 22:47 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	FRANCES COHEN: So you would go in as each city was liberated?

Subsequently, the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects (CROWCASS) was launched in September 1944: an American initiative, it utilized a punch-card index based on the Hollerith system. Walters has discussed the problems with the CROWCASS initiative (&quot;it stumbled over its own ambition&quot;), but CROWCASS lists were distributed to the CIC and other intelligence units (e.g., the United Nations War Crimes Commission) starting May 1945, and proved to be an important if imperfect resource.

He was the highest-ranking member of the SS to be tried at the International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg. The best study on him remains Peter Black&#39;s biography from 1984, which portrays Kaltenbrunner as a radical Nazi and chronicles the Austrian&#39;s rise to the top of the SS security apparatus. Black discusses Kaltenbrunner’s last days, after he left his political headquarters in Salzburg to head to Altaussee, which attracted many high-ranking Nazis at the war&#39;s end (see below), including Kaltenbrunner&#39;s childhood friend, Adolf Eichmann, who also took refuge in the mountains surrounding the town. On Kaltenbrunner’s trial before the IMT, Black notes: &quot;Most remarkable in Kaltenbrunner’s prison writings is the absence of any guilt, remorse, or even reflection on the millions of innocent people who had been murdered by the regime that he served or who had died as a result of its policies. On the contrary, he appears to have been convinced that he had always done right, that his actions had been necessary, and &#39;history&#39; would someday prove this.&quot; Peter Black, <em>Ernst Kaltenbrunner: Ideological Soldier of the Third Reich</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), 257-59, 271. Kaltenbrunner was sentenced to death and executed at Nuremberg on the night of the 15th of October 1946 (his body, and those of the other ten defendants who were executed, were transported to Munich and cremated, with the ashes dumped in the Isar River).</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r603" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="1397.39" data-end="1429.68" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="c4e79b95-4868-433e-a362-4c5d87fe84a8" data-uuid="b3dfc73e-4ed4-4f1d-a975-a113b10ef71e"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="1397.39" data-end="1429.68" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 23:17&nbsp;- 23:49 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> Jonathan Petropoulos Critical Edition [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">It seems that the response of many Germans, <em>ich war gezwungen</em> (‘I was forced to do it’) is a version of ‘I was just following orders.’ And every Nazi seemed to point to a Jew or to Jews whom he or she had saved.

Loyal to his home state, the Minnesota Historical Society biography of Mattson relates that he received his M.A. in public administration from Harvard University in 1940 and then taught political science at Carleton College from 1940 to 1942. Matteson briefly served as a state department desk officer in 1943, before going on to serve in the 80th infantry division of Patton&#39;s third army in 1943-1946. </p> 
 <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">After World War II, Matteson was research director for Harold Stassen&#39;s 1948 presidential campaign (1946-1948), and when Stassen served as president of the University of Pennsylvania (1948-1952), Matteson worked as his assistant (and an assistant professor of international relations). Matteson&#39;s government career began in 1953 when he joined Harold Stassen in the Foreign Operations Administration. Matteson was then director of the White House Disarmament Staff (1955-1958). He stayed with the Eisenhower administration after Stassen left in 1958, first as assistant to Sherman Adams, White House chief of staff, then with the CIA’s Board of National Intelligence Estimates (1959-1962). He then served in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1962-1967), in Vietnam as director of the military-civilian pacification program in the Agency for International Development as director of the Office of International Training (1968-1971), and with the Foreign Affairs Executive Seminar (1971). He also founded the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute at Northland College in Ashland, Wisconsin. Matteson&#39;s personal friends and professional associates included many top-level government officials.</p> 
 <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">After the war, Matteson became obsessed with Ernst Kaltenbrunner, and wrote <em>The Last Days of Ernst Kaltenbrunner</em>, published in 2007 by the CIA. Mattson knew a great deal about Nazi Germany—and his combination of intellectual firepower and spy-like daring-do made him a hero for Sydney Bruskin. See Robert Matteson, <em>The Last Days of Ernst Kaltenbrunner</em> (CIA Library’s Center for the Study of Intelligence, 2007), https://www.cia.gov/static/eb2a597a1af439815b52e9b7ab190daa/Last-Days-of-Kaltenbrunner.pdf. See also ‘The Last Days of Ernst Kaltenbrunner’ at https://www.memoiresdeguerre.com/article-the-last-days-of-ernst-kaltenbrunner-83009915.html, which latter document states that Matteson’s account was released by the CIA in 1993. In 1980 he also published a memoir, <em>A Search For Adventure</em>, the relevant section of which is part III, the war years (1940-1946).</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r606" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="1460.47" data-end="1494.7" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="f20551e2-f0e3-4b65-a5f7-8ddff6053a91"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="1460.47" data-end="1494.7" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 24:20&nbsp;- 24:54 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	And, um, inci-- incidentally, I was more proficient in French than German.

Located at the end of a long road heading deep into the Salzkammergut, Altaussee was a good location to stash art and for Nazis to hide out. The town was part of the Ausseerland region, which Hitler and his associates envisioned as part of the so-called Alpine Fortress. The town attracted an array of leading Nazis, including Kaltenbrunner, Adolf Eichmann, SS commando Otto Skorzeny, Viennese Gauleiter Hugo Jury, Franz Stangl (commandant of Sobibor and Treblinka) and Anton Burger (Commandant of the Theresienstadt concentration camp). Walters offered an extension of this list: “In Altaussee… among those arrested were General Erich Alt of the Luftwaffe, Walter Riedel, the construction chief of the V-2 rocket program at Peenemünde; Günther Altenburg, the German Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece; William Knothe, General Counsel of the Foreign Office; and Dr. Bailent Homan, a minister in the Hungarian puppet government installed by the Nazis.” In other words, Altaussee was an extraordinarily rich target area for Matteson, Bruskin, and their team. Most of the gold and other valuables disappeared at the war’s end and have never been recovered. Walters, Hunting Evil, 14-15.

From here, with the help of an RSHA staffer named Wilhelm Höttl, he became embroiled in Operation Sunrise: an effort to conclude a negotiated peace for Italy and western Austria with the Western Allies. While those negotiations bore fruit (a separate peace was concluded on 29 April), troops from the U.S. Seventh Army arrived on 8 May (the day the Soviets concluded their treaty of surrender with the German government), and Kaltenbrunner again took flight. He headed to the hills near Wildensee, just outside Altaussee, where he hid out until 12 May 1945. At the end of the war a box of 50-60 kilograms of gold and other valuables was found near the house in which Kaltenbrunner had lived. Walters adds: “Kaltenbrunner’s house in Altaussee was the Villa Kerry, which was situated on the outskirts of town and looked over the lake. Before he fled, like some villain in a potboiler, Kaltenbrunner buried his treasure in his garden. According to one estimate, he had shipped to Altaussee 50 kilograms of gold bars, fifty cases containing gold articles, two million US dollars, the same number of Swiss francs, five cases of jewels, and a stamp collection worth five million gold marks.” Walters, <em>Hunting Evil</em>, 14-15.

Reinhard Heydrich (1904-4 June1942), number two in the SS, the preceding chief of the RSHA (which included the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD), the man who chaired the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, and the Acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, was assassinated by Czech partisans. Heydrich died from an infection (sepsis) caused by the horsehair fibers in the seat of his car, which entered his wounds after a kind of hand-grenade exploded near him. Hitler ordered a reprisal—the execution of 10,000 randomly chosen Czechs—but subordinates counseled that this measure could hurt the productivity of the important industrial region. The Germans instead decided to enact revenge in the towns of Lidice and Lezaky: on 10 June 1942, males over the age of 16 in both towns were murdered; and all the women in Lezaky were killed.

Bruskin describes a classic ploy here to confirm the identification of Kaltenbrunner and his adjutant, Arthur Scheidler. Bruskin developed a curious relationship with the two women: even the fact that Scheidler’s wife (Iris Scheidler) and Kaltenbrunner’s mistress were living in the same house raises questions. </p> 
 <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">Countess Gisela von Westarp (1920-1983) had married Paul Wolf (1912-1943) in 1940, but he died in Tunis in 1943. Countess Westarp went on to have twins by Ernst Kaltenbrunner (a boy and a girl), who “had been delivered in a cowshed in the village [Altaussee] on March 12 [1945].” She and the children survived the war, initially living in a two-room flat in Munich, according to <em>Der Spiegel </em>magazine in 1947. Walters, <em>Hunting Evil</em>, 12-13. “Gräfin Gisela von Westarp,” in <em>Der Spiegel</em> 9 (28 February 1947). Kaltenbrunner had married Elisabeth Eder in 1934 and they had three children, who also survived the war.</p> 
 <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">Walters says, “Scheidler’s wife was a vivacious and attractive thirty-three-year old brunette called Iris. A Viennese by birth, Iris had previously been married to a Dr. Rudolf Praxmarer, who was a friend of Kaltenbrunner when they had studies at the University of Graz. The couple separated amicably in July 1943, and Iris became frau Scheidler the following month…. She combined parenthood with working for the official Nazi photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, which gave her access to what passed for high society in Nazi Germany, including Eva Braun and Baldur von Schirach, the leader of the Hitler Youth. In short, the Scheidlers were a well-connected couple, and they were at the heart of the Kaltenbrunner clique in Altaussee.” Walters, <em>Hunting Evil</em>, 13.</p> 
 <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">Both sides used one another. The women sought information about their husband/boyfriend, as well as more lenient treatment. The Allies sought the location of the suspects and useful information. The interrogations of spouses and paramours became part of the archival record. Margaret Himmler, for example, was taken by US troops from the Tegernsee in Bavaria to Italy and questioned there for weeks.

Scheidler had joined the Nazi Party in January 1930 and the SS in 1934 and become Heydrich’s administrative aide in 1939 (a post he held until 1942). He had also been a guard at the Sachsenburg concentration camp near Chemnitz in Saxony. After Heydrich’s assassination in June/July 1942, Scheidler continued as Kaltenbrunner’s adjutant. Obersturmbannführer Scheidler was in Altaussee at the war’s end, along with his wife, Iris. He was transferred to the Headquarters of US Forces European Theater Interrogation Center APO 635 on 23 May 1945. There are reports that Scheidler was executed by the Americans after the war, but this appears not to have been the case. Lt.

He leaves out certain specifics, of course, such as that Adolf Eichmann was with Kaltenbrunner in the escape from Altaussee and before he separated from his group and hiked through the mountains heading north (he was captured later and then escaped again to South America). Bruskin also did not note that the assistant Burgermeister of Altaussee, Johann Brandauer, was the one to reveal the location of Kaltenbrunner’s hideout in the Todes Gebirg; Brandauer accompanied the detachment of ex-Wehrmacht soldiers and US troops. The mission entailed climbing over mountainous and glacial terrain for six hours in darkness before arriving at the cabin. See <em>The Last Days of Ernst Kaltenbrunner</em>, CIA–Kent School: Center for the Study of Intelligence (retrieved 14 July 2019). Walters tells a similar story, referring to Matteson as “a political–science teacher and a Harvard MA,” with “his interpreter Sydney Bruskin.” See Walters, <em>Hunting Evil</em>, 15. Regarding the capture that took place on 11/12 May 1945, Walters writes: “Matteson’s motley crew departed at midnight, their leader sporting a pair of Lederhosen, an Alpine jacket and hat, and spoked shoes. The plan was for an unarmed Matteson to pose as an innocent passerby…” See Walters, <em>Hunting Evil</em>, 16.  Matteson indeed approached the hut by himself, with his US GIs and four German guides remaining at a distance. Matteson knocked on the door, and one of Kaltenbrunner’s assitants answered it. Matteson asked to come in, but was refused. At that moment, Kaltenbrunner’s aide spotted Matteson’s support team and slammed the door. A standoff ensued, but Kaltenbrunner chose to avoid a fire-fight and surrendered. Matteson brought him back to Altaussee. See Walters, <em>Hunting Evil</em>, 15-18. So, Bruskin was there for Kaltenbrunner’s arrest. He assented to the decision to allow Kaltenbrunner to have a final meetingwith his mistress, Countess von Westarp. Bruskin and Matteson probably knew it would be difficult for her to see him after his arrest (unlike Kaltenbrunners wife, who had some rights). It is somewhat surprising that Sydney Bruskin and Robert Matteson didn’t recognize Kaltenbrunner, whose distinctive scars were famous.</p> 
 <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">At the International Tribunal at Nuremberg, Kaltenbrunner was charged with conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. He was acquitted of the first charge, but found guilty of the latter two. He had not been present at the beginning of the proceedings after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage, but when he returned, he protested his innocence, claiming that Himmler and Gestapo leader Heinrich Müller bore responsibility for the atrocities committed during his tenure as chief of the RSHA. Kaltenbrunner also maintained he was unaware of the Holocaust, and in a contradictor manner, stated that he had protested against the treatment of the Jews to Himmler and Hitler. He went so far as to claim that he deserved credit for bringing the Final Solution to an end. On 30 September 1946, the International Military Tribunal found Kaltenbrunner not guilty of crimes against peace, but guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity (counts three and four). On 1 October 1946, the IMT sentenced him to death by hanging. Kaltenbrunner was executed 16 October 1946, and his corpse, like those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann Göring (who had committed suicide the previous day), was cremated at the Eastern Cemetery in Munich and the ashes scattered in a tributary of the Isar River.

In negotiations that extended back to February 1945, the U.S. was represented by OSS operative Allen Dulles (the brother of future Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who himself later directed the CIA), while the Germans were represented by SS General Karl Wolff, whom Hitler had entrusted to command that portion of Italy occupied by the Germans. Wolff was subsequently treated very leniently by the Allies, and faced minimal justice only late in his life. See Allen Dulles, <em>The Secret Surrender</em> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1966); Bradley Smith and Elena Aga Rossi, <em>Operation Sunrise: The Secret Surrender</em> (New York: Basic Books, 1979); Kerstin von Lingen, Allen Dulles, <em>The OSS, and Nazi War Criminals: The Dynamics of Selective Prosecution </em>(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013); and David Talbot, <em>The Devil’s Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA and the Rise of America’s Secret Government</em> (New York: Harper, 2015).</p> 
 <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">Many top leaders, including Reichsführer-SS Himmler, hoped that fanatical SS troops would carry on the fight and survive to bring about a resurgence of National Socialism (a Fourth Reich, so to speak). Himmler also presented a peace plan that entailed the Germans making peace with the Western Allies and continuing the fight, this time as a coalition, against the Soviets. For top Austrian Nazis like Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Adolf Eichmann, and the others previously mentioned as present in Altaussee, among others, they hoped that their knowledge of this region of the Alps would enable them to escape from the enemy. In certain case, this occurred, as with Austrian SS officer Adolf Wächter, who took refuge in the Alps and benefitted from the Vatican (and U.S.) aided ‘Ratline.’ Author Philippe Sands noted in his riveting account of Wächter that the Americans never climbed above 10,000 feet, a tendency known by Wächter and his wife Charlotte, who helped supply him during his flight.

Dan Porat notes in his study of these prosecutions of kapos that “the trials exposed the tragic experiences of the kapos, over time the courts and the public shifted from seeing them as evil collaborators to victims themselves, and the fervor to prosecute them abated.” Still, according to <em>The Jewish Chronicle</em>, the word represented “the worst insult a Jew can give another Jew.” Primo Levi reflected on the challenges of evaluating the actions of the kapos: “Judgment becomes more tentative and varied for those who occupied commanding positions: the chiefs (Kapos….)… Levi, The Drowned and the Saved (New York: Vintage Books, 1988), 45.

Initially, the Allies frequently overfed the liberated prisoners, whose systems were not prepared for the kind of solid food provided. This became known as ‘refeeding syndrome.’ The Allies soon learned to gradually increase the portions, and this worked in many cases, although, of course, many perished after liberation. The treatment of liberated inmates was by no means uniform, with some experiencing discrimination, mistreatment, and terrible conditions. Earl Harrison, an American representative to the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees, commented at one point, “we appear to be treating the Jews as the Nazi treated them except that we do not exterminate them.” Jennifer Orth-Veillon noted, “…not all soldiers acted equally when confronted with that responsibility, and some further mistreated them, extending the trauma they had endured while imprisoned.” See Jennifer Orth-Veillon, “For Some Holocaust Survivors, Even Liberation Was Dehumanizing,” in <em>New York Times</em> (28 April 2020). </p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r687" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="2630.76" data-end="2667.996" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="78de6ea1-dc2f-421f-b34e-efc45cf866bc"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="2630.76" data-end="2667.996" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 43:50&nbsp;- 44:27 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	Well, we learned other things later, for instance, that there-- there was a big, eh, eh, counterfeiting group there.

The Nazis used over 140 mostly Jewish skilled inmates, who received better treatment. They actually forged some 70 million notes with a value over 100 million pounds. The quality of the notes was very high and threatened the British economy, but the Germans never found a way to insert the notes into circulation: they had considered dropping them from planes, but did not pursue that option, and instead used the fake money to fund special operations. In early March 1945, the inmates in the counterfeiting unit were transferred to the concentration camp of Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria. Some of the Sachsenhausen prisoners ended up at Ebensee, which, as noted earlier, was also part of the Mauthausen-complex. The prisoners were ordered to destroy the evidence of the operation. See Bryan O. Burke, <em>Nazi Counterfeiting of British Currency during World War II</em> (London: Book Shop, 1988). The liberation of the Dachau camp offers another example of retribution against German guards by both American liberating troops and camp inmates.

In his testimony, he mentions experiencing antisemitism before the war, and also in postwar America. There is the curious use of the phrase “Jew boy”: he is being self-deprecating, but the phrase also seems to grow out of his own experiences with antisemitism. His explanation of how he chose his temple is also interesting: he conveys he so wanted to develop a religious identity, to develop that part of his life, that there was a real urgency. B’nai B’rith is a Jewish service organization whose members are committed to the Jewish people and the state of Israel. Founded in 1843 in New York City by recent German-Jewish immigrants, the organization also undertakes anti-defamation efforts, educational initiatives, and provides scholarships to young people. By 1956, Bruskin was involved with organizing the 100th anniversary of the B’nai B’rith chapter in New Haven (he is listed on the program as responsible for “tablet dedication”). See https://www.bnaibrith.org/uploads/7/8/5/9/7859990/conn.pdf. Bruskin was not alone among the Jewish American soldiers whose wartime experience shaped them: see Deborah Dash Moore, <em>GI Jews: How World War II Changed a Generation</em> (Cambridge; Harvard University Press, 2006); and the movie <em>GI Jews: Jewish Americans in World War II</em> (2018, directed by Lisa Ades), which examines the experiences of Mel Brooks, Henry Kissinger, and Carl Reiner, among others. Primo Levi recalled of the Allied liberators in The Reawakening: “They did not greet us nor did they smile. They seemed oppressed not only by compassion but by a confused restraint, which sealed their lips and bound their eyes to the funeral scene.” (Quoted in Jennifer Orth-Veillon, ‘For Some Holocaust Survivors, Even Liberation Was Dehumanizing,’ <em>New York Times</em>, 28 April 2020). Clearly, the liberators experienced something so profound that it shaped many of them in fundamental ways.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r702" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="2868.16" data-end="2916.995" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="78f9a378-288c-41b3-bc62-e271b9254720"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="2868.16" data-end="2916.995" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 47:48&nbsp;- 48:36 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	And, um, then-- let&#39;s see, all right, th-- then b-- back at Altaussee, uh-- oh, there were other people that we arrested there.

In 1933, he had been court martialed for selling military secrets to a foreign state and served a five-year sentence. Upon his release in 1937, he moved to Austria and by 1940 had obtained German citizenship. Baillie-Stewart had an aristocratic diction and likely inspired the name, “Lord Haw-Haw.” Because another British national, William Joyce, proved more effective, Baillie-Stewart only broadcast on German radio until December 1939, thereafter working as a translator for the German Foreign Ministry. When Baillie-Stewart was arrested by Matteson and Bruskin at Altaussee in 1945 he was wearing Lederhosen and trying to blend in with the local population. Subsequently he was sent to Britain to be tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he became known as ‘the officer in the Tower’ (he was often confused with Lord Haw-Haw). Baillie-Stewart was subsequently charged with “committing an act likely to assist the enemy” and sentenced to five years in prison. He was fortunate: William Joyce, who had been captured in Flensburg on 28 May 1945, was treated more harshly: charged with high treason, found guilty, and executed in 1946. Baillie-Stewart moved to Ireland after his release and lived under an assumed name. His biography appeared in 1967, a year after his death.

The Gauleiter of the Upper Danube (Oberdonau) region, which included the Mauthausen concentration camp, and an SS Obergruppenführer. Eigruber counted among the most radical Nazi leaders (he had joined the Nazi Party in 1928, especially early for an Austrian). At the war’s end, he ordered bombs to be placed in the entrance to the Altaussee salt mine, where thousands of artistic masterpieces, including the Ghent altarpiece, were stored. Eigruber issued an order that the treasures must not fall into enemy hands—an order that was thankfully subverted (with the help of Austrian miners). Eigruber himself fled Linz using forged papers, and he too was in the Salzkammergut at the time Kaltenbrunner was hiding out there. Matteson and Bruskin had intelligence that they were close behind Eigruber, but at the same time, they received the tip on Kaltenbrunner, and followed up that lead. Eigruber would not be captured until 11 August 1945, when he was arrested in the rural area of Sankt Pankraz in Upper Austria by a U.S. Counterintelligence Unit.</p> 
 <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">Gauleiter Eigruber was imprisoned at Nuremberg and then tried in one of the Dachau trials in 1946. The Dachau trials were carried out by the U.S. military between November 1945 and August 1948. They dealt with the significant Nazi war criminals that fell into American hands, including camp guards, SS doctors, and the perpetrators of the Malmedy massacre where 84 Americans were killed by Waffen-SS in late-1944. August Eigruber was found responsible for crimes at Mauthausen, convicted for crimes against humanity, and sentenced to death by hanging, a verdict that was carried out at the Landsberg Prison on 28 May 1947. The Eigrubers, who married in 1930, had five children (some sources say six), including FPÖ politician Hermann Eigruber.

The Prince was a Polish national (with an American mother) and his wife was the stepdaughter of the U.S. ambassador to Poland, Antony Drexel Biddle, Jr. Prince von Hohenlohe and Peggy Schulze had married in October 1938 in Paris after a four-month courtship. At the start of September 1939, the Prince was mobilized with the Polish armed forces and Peggy stayed with her mother and stepfather. She endured the initial German attack on Poland before being evacuated with other officials on 5 September. This entailed a harrowing twelve-day journey across Poland to Romania during which they experienced bombardment from German planes and machine-gun attacks. Prince Alexander reached Budapest and then reunited with his wife, before heading to New York, where they arrived on 4 November 1939. How Prince von Hohenlohe was arrested in Europe in 1945 by Robert Matteson is not clear.</p>  </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-row gap-[6px] annotationTags flex-wrap" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3">  <astro-island uid="ZmjVhh" prefix="r714" component-url="../../_astro/PopupWindow.DHZbISMJ.js" component-export="PopupWindow" renderer-url="../../_astro/client.BVnT0qhC.js" props="{&quot;count&quot;:[0,0]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PopupWindow&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div></div><template data-astro-template></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </div> </div> </div><div class="annotationNode flex flex-row justify-between gap-4 p-4 my-4 scroll-my-20 rounded-md bg-white " data-start="3109.7" data-end="3155.62" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" data-tags="[]" data-set="bd13ea6a-684d-4fa4-b7f2-8b6c19ddf4c0" data-uuid="aeeba25e-d377-4b01-aaa3-1042510a58f9"> <div class="flex flex-row gap-2 w-[120px] items-start"> <button class="playAnnotation" data-start="3109.7" data-end="3155.62" data-player-id="149a208d-e225-485e-8218-c14dc879c4d3" data-file="94661d87-d4d8-4e0d-b023-65ce961fa808" aria-label="play annotated segment"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Z"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.91 11.672a.375.375 0 0 1 0 .656l-5.603 3.113a.375.375 0 0 1-.557-.328V8.887c0-.286.307-.466.557-.327l5.603 3.112Z"></path></svg> </button> <p class="font-semibold text-sm"> 51:49&nbsp;- 52:35 </p> </div> <div class="w-full flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm"> <div> <span class="text-xs font-semibold bg-gray-200 py-1 px-2 rounded-md"> mssa_hvt_2348_p1of2_transcript.txt [Transcript] </span> </div> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> 	And, um, then, um-- let&#39;s see, where were we?

He experienced the Hungarian take-over of his town in late-1938, after the Germans were given the Sudetenland and arranged the award of land to Hungary. Havas was transported to Auschwitz on 15 May 1944, and then on to Mauthausen and then to Ebensee, where he spent one year prior to liberation. His father was a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz who perished in the October 1944 uprising. George Havas worked in the notorious tunnels at Ebensee. He lost his brother and several friends in the Ebensee camp. Only 16 when he was liberated, Havas was featured in some of the photos of the camp taken when the Americans arrived. See, for example, image 76788, at the USHMM at https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa7325. He immigrated to the USA in 1947 and lived in Virginia prior to his death in 2012.
